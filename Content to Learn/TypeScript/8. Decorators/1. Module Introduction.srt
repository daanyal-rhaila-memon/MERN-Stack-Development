1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,770
With generics out of the way.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:11,400
Let's dive into the next more advanced feature that would be decorators decorators are a feature which

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,050
can be very useful for met up programming.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,290
Now what does up programming mean.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:23,880
It means that you typically won't use tech writers that often to have a direct impact on the end users

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,870
of your page.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,580
So off the users visiting your page but instead decorators are particularly well suited instrument for

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,630
writing code which is then easier to use by other developers.

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,310
Now that might sound strange but you'll see what I mean from this module.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,620
In the end it all comes down to the fact that unlike with Abra code snippets let's say when we add an

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,820
event listener we can easily write code which have a direct impact on the users of our page.

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,300
If we register a listener on the button and we show an alert after the button gets clicked then the

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,710
user visiting our page immediately see something with decorators we don't typically work on that.

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,490
But instead we can for example guarantee that one of our classes gets used correctly or a method in

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,230
a class where we do some hidden transformation stuff like that.

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,500
So in detail in this module we'll see what exactly decorators are about and why we would use them.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,690
We will of course use them and you will learn about the different types of decorators types supports

18
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,860
and we'll see a couple of examples that should make it clearer which role decorator is Phil and why

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,070
it can be useful.
