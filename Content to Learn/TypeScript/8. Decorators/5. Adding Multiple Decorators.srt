1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,290
So we now saw a more useful decorator.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,570
I want to conclude this very basic introduction to decorator with another important thing you should

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,080
know.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,770
You can add more than one decorator to a clause or anywhere else where you can use a decorator.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,110
So let's also add the logger decorator heater for example like this.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:29,040
If we save that you see it compiles without errors and indeed we see the log message here as well.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,510
This just leaves one important question in which order do these decorators execute.

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,920
Well for dad to find out let's for a log messages into both.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,370
We do have a log message and a logger obviously.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,390
Now let's go to the decorator function.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:50,090
So to the inner function of with template and say rendering template for example.

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,660
And now let's see in which order these functions are executing and in which order these log statements

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:02,590
are printed and we see rendering template runs first and then we get the logger output.

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:08,470
Now what this tells us of course is that they execute bottom up the bottom most decorator first and

15
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:15,260
they're often the decorators above it with template runs first then logger executes an important.

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,670
I'm talking about the actual decorator functions.

17
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,200
The decorator factories here run earlier.

18
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:31,090
If we have logger factory here and we have the same log in the template factory.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,420
So dare I say template factory in my log you will see that there actually the logger factory runs first

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,550
and then we got the template factory and that makes sense because in the end even though we get this

21
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,870
at symbol here here I'm executing a function and we're doing the same here.

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,720
And of course regular javascript rules apply here and dysfunction execution happens before dysfunction

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,530
execution which is why we see the logger factory before we see template factory.

24
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:06,130
So the creation of our actual decorator functions happens in the order in which we specify these factory

25
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:13,930
functions but the execution of the actual decorator functions then happens bottom up which means the

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,320
bottom most decorator executes first.

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,550
So this decorator function enter after the decorator above that executes it's just something you have

28
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:32,250
to know with that we got a solid base knowledge about decorators and you also saw a more advanced decorator

29
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,150
which hopefully also gives you a first impression of Y decorators can be useful especially if you also

30
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,970
think about frameworks like angular.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,440
Now let's see to which other places besides clauses we can add decorators and what we might be able

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,190
to do their.
