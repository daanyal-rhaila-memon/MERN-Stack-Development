1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,400
Of course you could also have arrow functions which don't need arguments,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,260
for example you could have the greet function which would look like this.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,590
You need to pass an empty pair of parentheses,

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,060
that is required if you have no argument,

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,140
again the only exception would be if you only have one argument, then you could leave out the parentheses

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,860
but for zero arguments or more than one, you need parentheses and if you have no argument, well then

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,700
you just call your function body like that for example

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,960
and then I could just log hello to the console

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:43,300
and again if I call the greet function thereafter and have a look at the console and I will reload my

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,980
page so that you can clearly see this, we see Hello here.

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,810
So as you see, this works fine too and you don't have to pass arguments to arrow functions to have them

12
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,940
work correctly. To also give an example for this one parameter case

13
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:04,510
I was talking about, if you have greetFriend here and you want to greet a friend, then you could

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,180
have the friend name and now notice,

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm not assigning the type of friend here which I should do

16
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,000
but this syntax here would give me errors.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,480
So I have to leave away the type declaration if I want to use this no parentheses syntax

18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:27,840
but keep in mind, declaring the type or explicitly stating which type this is is always better.

19
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,910
But this would be kind of the shortest way I could write this console log friend and then I could call

20
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,200
greetFriend and could call Manu or greet

21
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,330
Manu here.

22
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:46,300
So if I save this and go back to the application, you see that I greeted Manu here at the very bottom

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,960
of the page.
