00:00:01,670  -->  00:00:08,030
So we had a look at some of the most important ES6 changes or syntax changes and how we may use them

2

00:00:08,030  -->  00:00:15,200
with TypeScript. That already allows you to write much better code and much leaner code and use many

3

00:00:15,200  -->  00:00:17,050
of the cool new features.

4

00:00:17,060  -->  00:00:22,590
Now as I mentioned in the intro video, this is no ES6 course, TypeScript supports more features

5

00:00:22,630  -->  00:00:25,950
ES6 offers than the ones you saw in this module.

6

00:00:26,000  -->  00:00:31,940
Basically, you should reach out to a dedicated ES6 course to learn more about that and then have a

7

00:00:31,940  -->  00:00:37,760
look at this compatibility chart to see if the feature you want to use is supported by TypeScript, in

8

00:00:37,760  -->  00:00:40,700
which case you're good to go.

9

00:00:40,700  -->  00:00:43,470
Now with that, definitely have a look to

10

00:00:43,640  -->  00:00:49,780
dedicated ES6 resources to unleash the full power of TypeScript combined with ES6.
