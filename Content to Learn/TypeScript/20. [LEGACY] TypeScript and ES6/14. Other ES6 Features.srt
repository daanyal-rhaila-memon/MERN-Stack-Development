00:00:01,890  -->  00:00:04,010
Now there are a couple of other additions

2

00:00:04,020  -->  00:00:12,200
ES6 offers you and TypeScript covers too, for example symbols, iterators or generators

3

00:00:12,510  -->  00:00:20,880
and I deliberately cut them out here because these are more advanced concepts and they have nothing

4

00:00:20,880  -->  00:00:22,210
to do with TypeScript,

5

00:00:22,240  -->  00:00:25,840
they're ES6 features supported by TypeScript

6

00:00:26,040  -->  00:00:32,580
but again, this is no ES6 course, it's about learning TypeScript and I showed all these features because

7

00:00:32,640  -->  00:00:40,110
these things here are things you'll probably often use in your TypeScript programs and therefore, it's key

8

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:43,230
to understand how they work and that they exist.

9

00:00:43,620  -->  00:00:49,910
Now symbols, iterators and generators are probably something you don't need to use every day

10

00:00:50,010  -->  00:00:57,120
and therefore, I think the best solution here is if you will learn about them in dedicated ES6 resources

11

00:00:57,480  -->  00:01:04,140
and then you can remember this section here and know that you can use them in the exact

12

00:01:04,140  -->  00:01:07,180
same way in a TypeScript program.
