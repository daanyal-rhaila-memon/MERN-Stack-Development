00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:08,290
Welcome to the next module in this course. Now that we know what types are and how we can use them,

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,650
let's have a look at another cool feature or

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:19,540
key advantage TypeScript offers you. TypeScript gives you access to a lot of the ES6 features, so of next

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,580
generation Javascript and that it does today.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:30,700
So your code, since it will compile to ES5 will run in all browsers, even though you're using

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,710
ES6 features,

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,580
how cool is that?

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,920
Advantages TypeScript offers plus ES6 equals awesome.

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,090
Well, there's one thing to keep in mind,

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,790
Typescript doesn't support all features of ES6 yet

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,930
and to find out which features are supported,

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,020
have a look at this compatibility chart to which you'll find a link in the next lecture.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:00,760
Here, you get this TypeScript row and you can learn which features of ES6 you may safely use with TypeScript.

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,880
Now as you see, that basically are a lot but there are also some features which are not supported, which may

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,800
not be important to you but it's important to know what you may use and what you may not use.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,140
Throughout this module,

17
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,240
I'll give you a brief introduction to some of the core features of ES6.

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:26,650
This is no ES6 course though, so don't expect to get a full ES6 introduction here, again just to some of

19
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,890
the core new additions or syntax changes like arrow functions or the let and const keywords.

20
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:39,980
If you want to learn more about ES6, have a look at a dedicated ES6 course. As it turns out, I also do

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,890
have such a course, might be interesting to you.

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,420
Well enough of the advertising, let's dive into this module.
