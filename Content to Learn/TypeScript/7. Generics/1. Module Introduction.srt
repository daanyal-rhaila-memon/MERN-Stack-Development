00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,450
In this module we'll dive into a concept called generics.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,920
Generics exist in typescript not in vanilla javascript.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,620
So there is no real translation here but we can utilize him in typescript and the concept of generic

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,230
types all exists in our programming languages not in all our programming languages of course but in

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,860
some.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,250
For example in C sharp now this course of course is not about C sharp though.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,730
So let's have a look at what generics are and what they are in typescript and how we use them there

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,250
and why we use them there.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,920
Specifically we'll have a look at what exactly generics are and why they are interesting and helpful.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,570
We'll then build our own generic functions and classes because turns out we can do that will then have

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,670
a look at generic constraints and what that is and why we would use something like that.

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,080
And we'll have a look at a couple of special typescript types which also typically are generic and which

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,830
we do have for only really can understand now.

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,120
So let's see what we got there.
