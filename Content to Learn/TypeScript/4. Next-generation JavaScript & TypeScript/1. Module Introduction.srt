1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,340
Now did we have a good understanding of the basic types good features and what typescript adds.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,280
And we also understand how to typescript compiler works.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,880
Let's have a look at what else typescript has to offer specifically when it comes to modern javascript

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,750
syntax.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,660
Now this is a difficult a pretty wake term but in the end what I mean by that are javascript features

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,170
which have been around for a few years by now and which are well-supported in modern browsers but which

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,530
don't necessarily run in all especially in older browsers and there especially in Internet Explorer.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,700
I'm talking about things like let concert arrow functions D structuring syntax spread.

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,390
Operator and so on.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,920
So if debt is something you absolutely know you can skip this module because it will also refresh the

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,930
knowledge on these topics but I'll also explain what typescript does with these things with this syntax.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,420
Though the short story is typescript compiles it's such that it works nonetheless.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,250
We'll take a look at that but you can skip this module if that's all stuff you already know.

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,840
You can just have a look at the curriculum and see if there is any lecture in this module which might

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,200
still be interesting to you.

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,490
Otherwise as you often does module if you're not sure about these features if you know javascript regarding

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,840
var and so on but you don't know what the LAT or con's keyword really means.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,020
Then you should stick with me and dive into this module for that I got a brand new project set up you'll

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,390
find it attached and you always need to run npm install first in these projects don't forget this to

20
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,340
install all dependencies and thereafter always NPM start to start up that development server.

21
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,520
Now this is a project basically as we had it before.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:52,400
At the end of last module is conflict file with a pretty strict configuration an apt yes file here and

23
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,170
that this folder will be generated automatically by the way.

24
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,630
Keep this development severe running of course as you did before and now we can always compile our code

25
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,050
with the T S C command here or.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,190
And that's what I'll do here.

27
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,980
TSC dash W to enter watch mode and make sure we recompile whenever we change something.

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,180
So now that's our project setup and now we'll dive into some next gen Java's good features which types

29
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,070
of supports and what you should be aware of.
