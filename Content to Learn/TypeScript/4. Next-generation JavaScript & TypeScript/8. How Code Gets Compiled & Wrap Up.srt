1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,030
Now this is it for this module.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,810
Obviously modern JavaScript has a couple of other neat features as well.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:13,480
For example I'll cover classes in the class module and in general this is no javascript course.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:20,120
I don't want to bore you with tons of JavaScript knowledge that doesn't really relate to typescript.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,750
I wanted to mention these specific features because it's good to know that typescript helps us use these

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,860
features in a way that still runs in older browsers because that is something which you must never forget.

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,550
Your code gets compiled.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:43,210
Currently I have to target set to iOS 6 and therefore if we check the dist folder we see constants on

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,020
are all available in the app j ust file as well.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,610
Object restructuring also is a way of like this stair because all these features are supported in iOS

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,400
6.

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,880
If it would set the target to is 5 and a comment out lip now so that the correct lips are imported for

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,780
the years 5 target which will happen by default you will see that the generated code now looks quite

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,320
different.

15
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,240
It's way longer because now we're using var and typescript had to find work arounds for certain sudden

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,890
taxes that are not supported in EA's 5 javascript for example that the structuring syntax was removed.

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,000
So that's an important thing to always keep in mind.

18
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:28,810
Typescript compiles your code not just from typescript only features to regular javascript but also

19
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,960
from modern javascript to old javascript.

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,290
If you tell typescript to do so.
