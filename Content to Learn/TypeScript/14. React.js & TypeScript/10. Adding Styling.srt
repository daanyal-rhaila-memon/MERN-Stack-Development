00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,130
Now to finish up this application let's add some styling attached to find a new to do C S S and a To

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:14,120
Do List C S as file simply drag and drop them into your components folder and then in New to do t is

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,600
x.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,870
Let's import dots slash new to do dots see us s.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,170
This uses DB behind the scenes project setup we have here which will pull out that C is US code and

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,740
then add it to our single page H TO MAIL file we're using and in new to do component on the div also

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:37,820
add a class here with the class name prop of form dash control and with that added in to do list of

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,940
course import that dot slash to do list C is as follows.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,810
And with that once you did that you should have something that looks like this.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,840
And there we can now add finish the course finish it in one month.

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,830
It does looks a bit nicer I'd say we all have the working buttons of course still and that's our finished

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,900
application here.
