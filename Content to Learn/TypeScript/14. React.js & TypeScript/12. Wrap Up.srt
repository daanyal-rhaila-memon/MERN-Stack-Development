00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,770
So in this module we had a look at react and TypeScript and as you see typescript here again can add

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:16,040
a lot of nice extra features and checks that make sure that we write clear an error free code.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,770
Now I did show you a couple of very important pattern stare and a couple of very important react features

4
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,980
like props and state and how to use them with typescript.

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,620
I also showed you how you should think about adding other functionalities like redux which we didn't

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,430
use in this module.

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,010
And as I also mentioned at the end of the last lecture don't forget about all the other things you learn

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,920
about in this course all the types you learn about and all the things you can do with typescript including

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,420
the configuration here everything you learned applies to this react plus types could project as well.

10
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,940
Just because we had a nice configuration out of the box here does not mean that you can't tweak it you

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,460
can tweak it and you can use everything you've learned in this course here in this project because after

12
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:13,800
all even though we're writing some reactive code and we can use J as X we're still writing javascript

13
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,560
or specifically typescript code and data for everything you'll learn from this course is valid here

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,360
as well.

15
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,810
It's easy to forget that so always keep it in mind.

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,560
And with that consider creating your next react project with typescript.

17
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,940
You know certainly know how to get started and how it works.
