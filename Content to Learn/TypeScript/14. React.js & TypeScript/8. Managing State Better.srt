1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,330
So how should we update the state instead.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:10,000
Well we can use our spread operator here and spread all our existing to do is into disarray and then

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,500
just add the new to do as a new item at the end.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,350
This works but it's not the cleanest way of updating this.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,720
It will most likely work in all scenarios we have in this app but theoretically react schedules state

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,690
updates and data for what's it are to do is value here might not necessarily be the latest state when

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,770
this update is performed to guarantee this we can pass a function to the state updating function or

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,700
though a function which gets our previous to do this and which then returns to new state.

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,580
This also is supported by react dysfunction will all be called by react for us and then we can rely

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:52,260
on prefer to do is inside of this function to really be the latest state snapshot.

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:58,930
Now with that we update our to do with with the Ulta dos and the new one and now we have a function

12
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,610
near where we should be able to add new to do this.

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:09,310
So if we now save all of that and we go back to the application and enter finish the course here does

14
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,330
works.

15
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,690
And if I enter finish it in one month here this is also added.

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,190
So this not all works the missing functionality now is that we can also delete them.

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,470
We'll do this in the next lecture but more importantly than that you now also learn how to manage state

18
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,570
with react and typescript which besides props of course is a number a core concept.
