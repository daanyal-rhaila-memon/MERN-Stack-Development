1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,680
In this course will obviously learned a lot about TypeScript and you'll all learn how to work with TypeScript

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,650
and third party libraries like lo Dash.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,930
Now there is a very popular third party library which you might be interested in using to gather with

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,110
TypeScript and that is react react.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:27,610
J.S. is a extremely popular javascript library for building amazing user interfaces and you can use

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,390
it with typescript as well.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,380
It's not the default in most react projects.

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,250
You don't work with typescript but you can absolutely do that.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
And in this course module you will learn how it works.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:45,660
Now a little disclaimer at this point this is not a react course I will not teach react here.

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,850
This module is for you if you already know react and you want to learn how to use TypeScript and react

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,220
not if you don't know react and you want to learn both TypeScript and react to gather.

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,680
But with that let's dive right in and let's see how we can build a reactor up with typescript.
