1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:08,410
Now with all the things we covered thus far in the course it's now time to practice a bit.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,870
We're definitely not done with typescript.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,130
There are more things to explore and more things will cover in the course.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,720
For example how we can combine TypeScript and react.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,010
But for the moment it's time to take a short break and practice some of the things we learned about

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,440
in a little demo project.

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:32,430
Now in this module we'll work on this project together but I definitely encourage you.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,590
Did you occasionally hit the pause button and tried the next steps on your own.

9
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:44,890
Of course following along is also great and nice but you might learn a bit more if you also try things

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,180
on your own before you then compare your solution to mine.

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,030
And with that let's dive right in and practice working with typescript.
