1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,790
And this is it for this little demo project.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,410
Now of course there's always more you could do.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,120
But here we're already using a bunch of nice types good features.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,120
You'll learn about wrote this course.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,620
And with this project you hopefully have a better idea of when we use which feature why certain features

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:30,680
like decorators and interfaces exist how they can help us and how we can write type safe scalable code.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,080
Now Definitely feel free to build up on this project add more features on your own explorer what you

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,840
could change there and simply practice working with typescript.

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,820
I'm happy with the current state and in the next module I now want to tackle a quite obvious problem.

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:56,010
We got one super huge file here so splitting this up into multiple files would really help us with managing

11
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,130
our code base because right now we want to change something somewhere.

12
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,400
We always have to scroll for the entire file and find the place where we want to make a change.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,980
That's not ideal.

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,530
This already is quite a lot of code an even bigger project.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,780
It would be totally unmanageable.

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,420
So in the next module we'll have a look at the features typescript gives us that help us with splitting

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,280
our code across multiple files.
