1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,290
To output more useful information about a single project item.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,560
Let's go to the project.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:14,230
Item class because that is where we render this and in the year when I set the content of the H free

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,370
tack which is dad a number of persons we could changed as to say number of persons which were out putting

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:31,930
here plus a signed so did we at least say if I rendered is five a signed but five assigned all day isn't

6
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:39,480
really a good wording right now we of course you could say five or whatever the number is persons assigned.

7
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:50,320
So if we say persons assigned here that is better whips testing test is work because now it is say is

8
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,010
five persons assigned.

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,900
Well that's better but it's still not optimal.

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,740
What if we only have a project with one person.

11
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,890
It still says persons and that doesn't make too much sense.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,810
Now I gather.

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,390
Can help us there.

14
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,640
So instead of saying persons or person here I just say plus assigned but actually don't just one output

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,000
the number of people here.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,050
I want to use a getter instead.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,840
Which returns us a proper term.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,660
So the right text basically.

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,050
So here I'll add a getter and convention not a must do but a convention you often see is to add getters

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,630
and setters right below your observe fields.

21
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,370
So I will add it here below my fields above the constructor.

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,510
Now I'll name it persons.

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,440
The name is totally up to you.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,660
I'll name it persons here and a getter is basically like a function.

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,180
So you have to add parentheses here and then curly braces.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,960
Now in there as you see you must return a value.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,620
And here I want to return value which is basically some text based on the number of people I have in

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:03,380
my project here so you can check if this project people is equal to 1.

29
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,330
In that case I will return one person as a text here.

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,170
Else I know it's more than one or zero.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,240
And in both cases I would say persons plural form.

32
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:25,150
I will return template literal actually simply because it's easier to write a text with injected content

33
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,910
with a template literal and there I'll say this project that people persons.

34
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,080
So now this is the text I return in this scenario.

35
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,360
So now we just have to use this getter to automatically get the right jargon the right text.

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,320
So down later instead of reaching out to this project people I will just say this person's assigned

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,510
and I exist is like a normal property.

38
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,590
So we're not calling this like a function with parentheses.

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,110
Instead we axis is like this but this will trigger this scatter because it is the same name.

40
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,450
So this will trigger the scatter run our logic there and then return the appropriate text.

41
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:12,490
So now if we try this again testing dust is work and I assign five we see five persons assigned.

42
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:19,360
Dust is really work for sure and I add one here we see one person assigned.

43
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,500
So now this works in the way I want it to work.

44
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,660
Now it is really outputs this properly and it shows a nice use case of a getter where it just helps

45
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,910
us transform data when we retrieve it.
