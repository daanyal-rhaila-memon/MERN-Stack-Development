1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,640
We can take this a step further,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,740
here's an advanced object.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:12,480
While it might look extremely strange and dangerous but it's really just putting together all of the

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,110
things we saw thus far.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:22,640
We have a variable named complex which should be an object as we can tell by the outer curly braces,

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:31,750
this one and this one. Now the object should have two properties, a data property and an output property.

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:38,650
The data property should be an array of numbers and the output property is actually a function as we

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,380
can tell by this type here.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,950
It has a function where we only have one argument which has the argument all but again, the name is

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,470
not relevant but it should be of type boolean,

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,100
that's important and it should give us back a number

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,580
array, so an array of numbers. This would be using all the things we saw before and I'm throwing it into

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:07,720
here to show you how to combine these types and how to build more complex objects with them while to

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,100
be honest, it still stays really easy to read

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,130
once you're into it and it makes sure that we can't assign this to a simpler object, like for example

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,630
an empty one to go with that very basic example again.

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,570
So if I try to compile this, we of course get an error that this does not satisfy this more complex type.
