00:00:01,930  -->  00:00:08,400
Exercise time. Here, we have some TypeScript code though it's really just Javascript

2

00:00:08,410  -->  00:00:13,840
if you leave away the let keyword, which would also be available in ES6 Javascript.

3

00:00:13,840  -->  00:00:16,650
So the basic thing is, we're not using types here.

4

00:00:16,930  -->  00:00:24,460
Now your goal is to take this code and be as explicit as possible regarding the types.

5

00:00:24,670  -->  00:00:32,620
I want you to rework this code so that you're assigning types wherever it is possible and be as well, explicit

6

00:00:32,800  -->  00:00:41,290
as you can be, to represent this code. So a rather short and quick challenge here but one that will really

7

00:00:41,290  -->  00:00:45,600
allow you to use the knowledge you learned before and take it into practice.
