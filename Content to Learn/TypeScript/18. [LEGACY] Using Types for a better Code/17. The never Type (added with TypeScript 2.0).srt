00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,230
With the release of TypeScript 2.0, if you are using that, you got access to a couple of new types or

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,350
new things regarding types,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,860
the first thing I want to show is the never type.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,980
Now as the name suggests, this is kind of a strange type because when would you assign never as a type?

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,850
It kind of means it's never relevant.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,480
Consider this function, never returns would be an appropriate name for example because what

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,520
this function does is it simply throws a new error with any error message.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,090
Now you could assign never to this and this would also be the type the TypeScript compiler automatically

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,350
infers.

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,790
Now why is this never?

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,260
Because this function never finishes,

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,690
it doesn't return void,

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,770
don't mistake it for a function which returns void,

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,430
for example if you would simply console log something here but this function actually returns an error.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,830
So it's not returning nothing, it's never returning anything,

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,080
that's the key difference to understand here,

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,900
this function has an error or throws an error and therefore never returns.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,890
So this is where you could specify never to make your intention clear.

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,120
That being said, it is something you probably won't use all over the place but you might use it in functions

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,260
or in parts of your code where you know it should never be reached because it kind of then is stuck

21
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,940
and never returns

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,030
and as here when you throw an error,

23
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,130
well that probably is not the place where you want to get with your code in the first place.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,570
Nonetheless, if you want to define such places in your application where you know oh

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,540
if I go there, then I never return,

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,180
well then this is the type you're going to use or TypeScript will automatically infer it anyways.
