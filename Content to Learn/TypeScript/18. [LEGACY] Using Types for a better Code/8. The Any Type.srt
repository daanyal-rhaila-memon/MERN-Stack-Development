00:00:01,960  -->  00:00:07,960
The last basic type I have here is the any type. We already had a look at that and it's not really

2

00:00:07,960  -->  00:00:15,730
that surprising. If I have a car and set it to type any, I can assign a string to it, BMW and then I can

3

00:00:15,730  -->  00:00:23,080
take my car object and log it to the console and thereafter, I can simply overwrite it to suddenly be

4

00:00:23,080  -->  00:00:26,620
an object where my brand now is BMW

5

00:00:26,980  -->  00:00:33,960
and I have the series with number three let's say and I can log this again.

6

00:00:34,250  -->  00:00:40,940
Now with this approach, I'm basically taking my car variable, set it to a string and then I set it to an

7

00:00:40,940  -->  00:00:42,110
object.

8

00:00:42,110  -->  00:00:49,460
Now if I wouldn't set any here like this, then I would get an error if I try to compile this. The reason for

9

00:00:49,460  -->  00:00:51,150
that error being that

10

00:00:51,170  -->  00:00:55,130
well it is a string, TypeScript infers this to be of type string

11

00:00:55,490  -->  00:00:58,490
and once we set it to an object, we get an error.

12

00:00:58,940  -->  00:01:00,900
So therefore, I'm setting it to type any

13

00:01:00,950  -->  00:01:02,930
and I showed you this earlier,

14

00:01:03,100  -->  00:01:03,550
any

15

00:01:03,570  -->  00:01:08,840
is the most flexible type you have in TypeScript and therefore, you should really carefully use

16

00:01:08,840  -->  00:01:09,270
it,

17

00:01:09,290  -->  00:01:13,080
it should really be an exception that you use any. Try to be explicit,

18

00:01:13,160  -->  00:01:14,290
try to avoid it,

19

00:01:14,450  -->  00:01:21,800
try to really find out which type you want to use and only if you really can't tell and need all the

20

00:01:21,800  -->  00:01:29,180
flexibility, then use any because any basically gives up all the features or all the advantages TypeScript

21

00:01:29,180  -->  00:01:31,990
offers you related to types.

22

00:01:32,000  -->  00:01:38,870
So with this set up, if I head over to the window, you see BMW and then this object,

23

00:01:39,020  -->  00:01:41,990
so with type any, this is a valid code and it works.
