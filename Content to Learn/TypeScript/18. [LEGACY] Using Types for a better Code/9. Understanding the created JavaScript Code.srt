00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:08,120
Now before I continue to put more advanced topics about types, like using them with functions and using

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,760
them in objects and so on, I want to answer one important question,

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,200
what does all this code actually get compiled to?

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,200
We use all these types here

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,820
and how does this look in Javascript code?

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,820
Well the best answer is to simply have a look.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,070
We can have a look at our app.js file which is the result of all these tsc commands I'm running

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,700
here, the compiled code

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,620
and as you see, all the types here are gone

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,670
and that's not really that surprising because Javascript doesn't have types in this way,

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,360
we can't assign types

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,480
therefore it's simply stripped out. The role of TypeScript is to be aware of the types and warn you at

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,630
compilation time, once the code has made it to Javascript code,

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,930
well you're done and

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,670
the only thing you're getting then are runtime errors again.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,960
So types are no longer available there

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,020
but it was the job of TypeScript to make sure you wouldn't assign anything wrong

18
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:12,030
before we get to that step, before we actually compile the code. Therefore you don't see any types here,

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,010
the only thing you do see is the enum here which is kind of constructed with this self-executed function

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,900
and this color object here.

21
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:27,580
So the enum is actually created in code here too, so that we have this mapping then and we actually do

22
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,440
print a number instead of the name we assigned. But that's the only thing,

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,590
all the other types are not really converted to Javascript because you can do this.
