00:00:01,740  -->  00:00:07,660
Staying in your world of arrays, we get a new type with TypeScript which isn't available in Javascript,

2

00:00:07,770  -->  00:00:09,390
tuples. Now

3

00:00:09,390  -->  00:00:17,000
tuples are really just arrays with mixed types and a limited number of items.

4

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:19,470
So let's say I want to store my address and

5

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:25,630
no, this is not my actual address and I would have this format, Superstreet.

6

00:00:25,950  -->  00:00:28,570
and then the house number, 99.

7

00:00:28,650  -->  00:00:31,500
That's just a normal array with a string and a number,

8

00:00:31,500  -->  00:00:32,480
nothing wrong with that,

9

00:00:32,480  -->  00:00:35,130
we could compile this, no error.

10

00:00:35,160  -->  00:00:40,020
Now if I'm sure that this array will always have this format, two items,

11

00:00:40,020  -->  00:00:41,340
first item is a string,

12

00:00:41,340  -->  00:00:43,360
second item is a number,

13

00:00:43,380  -->  00:00:50,040
then I could be explicit about this because right now, it's just assumed to be this type, an array

14

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:52,350
of any item or any type.

15

00:00:52,500  -->  00:00:59,910
So I could assign this to be a tuple by adding a colon and then square brackets and here, string and

16

00:00:59,910  -->  00:01:00,540
number

17

00:01:00,540  -->  00:01:02,540
in this case, so two items,

18

00:01:02,550  -->  00:01:03,740
first one is a string,

19

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:06,010
second one is a number,

20

00:01:06,040  -->  00:01:12,910
this is how I set up my tuple. And if I now were to reverse the order here, have the first item be a number

21

00:01:12,910  -->  00:01:14,760
and the second one be a string,

22

00:01:15,040  -->  00:01:22,600
well if I try to compile this, I now get an error because the order is important, a tuple really has

23

00:01:22,600  -->  00:01:23,270
to be that

24

00:01:23,290  -->  00:01:24,930
format, two items,

25

00:01:24,940  -->  00:01:28,440
first one being a string, second one being a number,

26

00:01:28,450  -->  00:01:32,990
all other combinations or values like this one here are not valid.

27

00:01:33,280  -->  00:01:40,360
So I have to revert this back to 99 at the second position to be able to compile this without any

28

00:01:40,360  -->  00:01:41,500
issues again.

29

00:01:41,500  -->  00:01:42,730
Now you see it works

30

00:01:42,730  -->  00:01:50,220
and this is how you can tuples if you've got some data object or some array which has one single way

31

00:01:50,230  -->  00:01:55,270
it may look like, if you get an array which has a fixed value format,

32

00:01:55,300  -->  00:01:56,140
to put it like that.
