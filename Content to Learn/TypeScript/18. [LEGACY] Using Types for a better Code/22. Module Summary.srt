1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:10,400
You took a huge first step, this first module was extremely important because types really are the meat

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,550
of TypeScript.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,930
Yes, it offers a lot of other cool features and you will learn about them throughout this course but types

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:27,500
are what give TypeScript their name and what make your programs much more safe or better. You will prevent

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,620
a lot of nasty bugs or errors happening where you don't get an error message to begin with

6
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:40,680
just by making sure that you are using the right types and not messing something up during development.

7
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:47,120
So with this foundation laid out, let's continue with the next features and other cool things TypeScript

8
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,870
offers you.
