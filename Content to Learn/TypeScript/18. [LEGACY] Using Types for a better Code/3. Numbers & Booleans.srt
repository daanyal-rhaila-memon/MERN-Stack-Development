1

00:00:01,790  -->  00:00:05,690
Speaking of numbers, that's of course another basic type we got available.

2

00:00:05,810  -->  00:00:13,880
So if I were to save my age here and put this to 27, then this would be a number

3

00:00:13,880  -->  00:00:18,410
and now of course, it would give me an error if I try to assign a string.

4

00:00:18,410  -->  00:00:20,150
So this also doesn't work

5

00:00:20,270  -->  00:00:23,670
and that's the other basic or one of the other basic types we have.

6

00:00:23,720  -->  00:00:25,800
Important to know regarding numbers,

7

00:00:25,850  -->  00:00:28,150
these can also be floating point numbers,

8

00:00:28,190  -->  00:00:28,820
that's also a 

9

00:00:28,830  -->  00:00:35,340
valid number. TypeScript doesn't differ or doesn't care about the type of the number,

10

00:00:35,360  -->  00:00:42,200
if it is an integer or a float, that is both type number, there is no differentiation between that,

11

00:00:42,230  -->  00:00:45,020
that's important to understand and to keep in mind.

12

00:00:45,170  -->  00:00:47,480
Now the third basic type we do have

13

00:00:47,510  -->  00:00:53,830
in both TypeScript and Javascript is the boolean. A boolean is simply true or false,

14

00:00:53,870  -->  00:01:01,340
so if we want to check if I do have some hobbies and surprisingly I do, well then I could set this to true,

15

00:01:01,910  -->  00:01:05,330
if I were to change my mind, I can set it to false.

16

00:01:05,330  -->  00:01:13,160
Now of course, the interesting question is what happens if I now reassign hasHobbies to let's say

17

00:01:13,190  -->  00:01:14,380
one?

18

00:01:15,020  -->  00:01:17,890
Well, the IDE is already not liking it,

19

00:01:17,900  -->  00:01:21,680
if I run tsc in the console, you see I get an error.

20

00:01:21,950  -->  00:01:27,830
So even though one could be cast to a boolean, you could say that one means true,

21

00:01:27,980  -->  00:01:35,300
it still gives me an error because one is a number and hasHobbies is a boolean and/or likes to have

22

00:01:35,300  -->  00:01:37,120
booleans and not numbers.

23

00:01:37,310  -->  00:01:40,380
So this gives me an error, even though you can cast it.
