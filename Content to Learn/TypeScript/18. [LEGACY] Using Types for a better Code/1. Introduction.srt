00:00:01,840  -->  00:00:08,160
Now after learning what TypeScript is, why we might want to use it, how we generally use it

2

00:00:08,320  -->  00:00:14,500
and after setting up our basic workspace, it's time to get started and learn about the most important

3

00:00:14,500  -->  00:00:18,640
feature of TypeScript, types. In this module, 

4

00:00:18,640  -->  00:00:22,340
you're going to learn how to use types, why they are awesome,

5

00:00:22,480  -->  00:00:27,330
how to be flexible about types and keep the best of both worlds,

6

00:00:27,370  -->  00:00:34,690
dynamic types of Javascript and strongly types or strong typings of TypeScript. You will learn which

7

00:00:34,690  -->  00:00:38,410
types exist and how you create your own types.

8

00:00:38,440  -->  00:00:44,300
So with that, enough of the introduction, let's get started and see how that all works.
