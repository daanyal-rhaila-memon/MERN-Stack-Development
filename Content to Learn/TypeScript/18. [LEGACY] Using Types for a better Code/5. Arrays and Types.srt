1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,670
Now that we had a look at these basic types, let's have a look at

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:12,610
a type you certainly know but which is a bit more advanced, the array type or @arrays.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,550
Let's say I would have some hobbies even though I state it to be false, if hobbies is an array of let's

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:27,410
say cooking and sports, then this is obviously my array

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,190
and I could log an item

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,970
to the console, so like hobbies 0.

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:41,950
Now to actually see that being logged to the console, I'll open a new window here and I'll run npm start

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,620
to start my lite server which we set up in one of the earlier videos and head over there, open up my

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,260
console,

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,740
we see cooking of course.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:59,480
So far, so not very spectacular but let's see, which type does this hobbies variable have? Well we can

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,830
check this by printing typeOf hobbies.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,860
If I save this and then recompile my code here,

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,100
now we see object here.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,240
Now that's not very surprising because obviously an array is an object.

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,860
The interesting part comes if we try to do something else,

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:27,940
if I take my hobbies variable here and I try to set this equal to a new array which holds one number,

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,730
100

19
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,290
and now I try to compile this,

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,300
I get an error,

21
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,400
the error is type number or array of numbers is not assignable to type array of strings.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,540
Now that might be a bit surprising but if you think about it, it's not, TypeScript infers the types automatically

23
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,990
and since we initialize this hobbies variable with an array of strings, it thinks that this should only

24
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,270
be an array of strings,

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,420
it doesn't allow any other types in this array.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,600
So if we then set it equal to an array of numbers, we therefore get an error, as soon as I change this to a

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,370
string again, the error is gone and I can then recompile this without any issues.

28
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,580
So that's important to keep in mind, using a number here will give us an error because TypeScript infers

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,990
this to be an array of strings.

30
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,700
Now we can overwrite this by assigning a type explicitly.

31
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,060
If I assign a type and set this to be an array of anything,

32
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,530
well now you see my IDE error is gone

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,320
and as soon as I recompile thsi, we see this error is gone too. The reason for this of course is that now I'm

34
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,220
overwriting the type TypeScript infers and I'm telling it 

35
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,620
no that's not only an array of strings, it may hold any item and I increase the flexibility of that

36
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:45,900
array

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,440
therefore. It still has to be an array of anything,

38
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,370
so setting hobbies to just 100 will still give us an error because that is just a number and not an

39
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:56,970
array.

40
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,630
So I only overwrote the types of the items in the array,

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,150
not that this is an array,

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,850
I set this by adding the square brackets here.
