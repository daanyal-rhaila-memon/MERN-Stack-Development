00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,950
I hope you enjoyed the exercise.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,370
Let's see if we have the same solution.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,070
It's not that much code but there are quite a cool things you can do with it.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,420
So we get this bank account optics here.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,370
Let's start with that let's assign type for this object.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,650
As I said you should be as explicit as possible.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,490
So even though this is of course inferred by typescript we want to assign it explicitly here.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,210
So obviously we have an object here as you can tell by.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,990
Well the right side of the equal sign in this object we get two properties.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,210
Money and deposit.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,530
Now the first property to me looks like a number.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,300
So we probably should make it type number.

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,660
The second property here is a function.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,470
Remember a function type looks like this parentheses.

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,060
And then this arrow is function doesn't return anything.

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,010
So let's add word here.

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,130
And what it does though is it has one argument.

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,820
So it has the argument value.

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,510
I'll just name it.

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,140
Well here to demonstrate that the name doesn't have to be equal and Velle is property of type number

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,400
since we add something to the money.

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,900
Now since we defined it up here we should also add it here.

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,140
So this is of type number and it returns nothing.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,240
So that looks a lot better to me now if that it looks like d bank account object is finished.

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,160
Let's move on to the second object myself.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,850
Now my of course also as an object and it has free properties.

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:47,560
Name a bank account and hobby's So name is clearly a string.

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,120
So let's add a string here.

29
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,270
Now the bank account is interesting because the bank account is of course the bank account object from

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,420
up here.

31
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,770
So I can just use this type definition and paste it into here.

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,190
Well to me that doesn't look super readable.

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,470
It also has the disadvantage.

34
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,590
If I were to change this object up here I have to change just type definition and this one number you

35
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,220
what I want.

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,380
So I'll reword this instead.

37
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,340
Let's create our own type for this.

38
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,030
So up here I'll add a new type and I'll name it bank account.

39
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,940
The name is of course totally up to you.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,380
And I'll set it equal cutis type definition I just copied.

41
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:37,790
Keep in mind since I'm creating a type here with the type keyword on the right side of the equals sign.

42
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:44,980
We don't have a value as a normal javascript but instead the value here is a type definition as we normally

43
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,700
only see it after a colon in when we create a variable here for example.

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,110
So there's this exception due to this type keyword with this type created.

45
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,770
I can now go to my bank account and of course set is equal to type bank account much shorter.

46
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,470
I can also copy this and set it equal here.

47
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,690
So now I'm reducing this type which makes it much more maintainable and saves me a lot of code.

48
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:18,710
Now to finish just myself object I have my hobbies aere and currently it's an array of strings.

49
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,430
Now it probably will never be anything else than that.

50
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,190
So it makes no sense to use any.

51
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,040
So I will keep it to a string array.

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,560
Now with that it looks like we're done here.

53
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:38,620
And this is the most explicit and structured way I can think of to assign types here and to use types

54
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:46,330
to make this code more readable and more safe to use as we're now not able to pass any invalid values

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,810
if you want to check this file compiled with TSC solution ts.

56
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,180
Otherwise you will get some strange error simply stemming from the fact that we're using the same names

57
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,450
here and that the exorcized Yes file
