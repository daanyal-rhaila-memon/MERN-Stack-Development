1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,110
So you did it.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,710
You'll finish this course and you learn a lot about typescript.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,310
I can only encourage you to keep on practicing and working with it and use all the cool features you'll

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,220
learn about.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,370
Now of course there also are Thurber resources which might be interesting to you.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,290
Most importantly the official typescript web page.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,020
There you can learn all about the niche features nitty gritty details and of course all the latest features

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,520
as well though to be honest we covered basically everything you find in there as well.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,540
But if you want to dive deeper want to learn more or want to have a written guide.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,830
This is a great resource to also learn about key concepts.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,590
I also covered for all this course.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,390
So this is one resource I would recommend dare you all to find a playground where you can quickly check

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:53,220
out some typescript scripts and run them here in the browser without any local setup.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:01,190
Now as a next step I also recommend that you have a look at some types of projects and add some examples.

15
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:08,870
For example angular angular is a browser site framework that uses typescript that is built up on typescript

16
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,970
so to say it embraces TypeScript and therefore learning angular can be a great idea.

17
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,080
Now I've got a complete course on angular if you're interested but even if you don't do you want to

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,710
work with angular debt much checking out their open source code base could be interesting as well just

19
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,590
to learn how they are using TypeScript and to give you some ideas on how you could use it in your future

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,030
projects.

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,260
It's similar for Nest.

22
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:41,540
J.S. I showed this Andy node module nest J.S. also has a framework that embraces typescript but unlike

23
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:48,530
angular which is for the browser side nest J.S. is based on no tree s and is for the service site side

24
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,250
nest J as is also a really cool framework that uses tons of amazing types of features and it can be

25
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:01,400
interesting if you want to build a node application with typescript or even if you don't want to do

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:08,150
that justice with angular you can check out their code base to get some ideas on how to use typescript

27
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,900
how to use certain features and how to build cool things with typescript.

28
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,340
And last but not least if you need some inspiration did some other tutorials and guides maybe you can

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,400
of course use Google for example Google for typescript examples to find more articles on what you can

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,570
do with typescript find some example projects simply so that you get more and more used to the language

31
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,030
and get used to how to work with that language and how to build certain features with that language

32
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,590
and with that.

33
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,690
And of course with this course which you can also use as a reference to which you can come back whenever

34
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,830
you need to.

35
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:52,510
You have plenty of resources that should ensure that you can become a real typescript master.

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,770
I wish you all the best.

37
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,680
And if you build something awesome definitely share it with me.

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,640
I'm super excited to see what you're building with help of discourse.
