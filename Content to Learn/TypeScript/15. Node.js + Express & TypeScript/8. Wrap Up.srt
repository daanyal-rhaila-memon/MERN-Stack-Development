00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,690
So that's it for this module you learned how you can use typescript in a node express application that

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:15,230
you can install extra types for Express and for node for example to get great types of support in your

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,800
files that you write the application like you would always write it but that for example your import

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,340
and export some text differs and that you can of course use types and also any other type could feature

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:35,690
you learn about you could use interfaces you could use decorators you could use in arms and tuples and

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:42,260
everything that's typed exclusive that all works here because we're writing a regular typescript application

7
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,040
here and it gets compiled with the normal types of compiler to regular javascript code javascript code

8
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,490
which then is executed with node J.S..

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:58,340
Now if you want to have more examples on how to work with TypeScript and Node express you can of course

10
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,610
from one simply google for node express typescript to find more examples but I can also strongly recommend

11
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,870
that you check out nest.

12
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:12,590
J.S. it's a notorious framework which embraces typescript whilst you can make note express work with

13
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,340
typescript as you solve for out this module.

14
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:22,040
This is a framework which gives you project node projects with Python support out of the box and it

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,870
embraces all these types of features like decorators and so on with Nestlé as you can build node web

16
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:37,130
applications rest api but all the applications where you render views or graph to LAPD you can build

17
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:44,880
that all with no choice but also with TypeScript and this project heavily uses features like decorators

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,980
interfaces and so on.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,530
So definitely check out Nestlé s if you want to build service side web applications with node and typescript.

20
00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:00,380
It's a great framework really fun to use and uses all the cool features types has to offer.

21
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,980
So no custom type installation work arounds or anything like that is needed here.

22
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,750
You get great types could support out of the box.
