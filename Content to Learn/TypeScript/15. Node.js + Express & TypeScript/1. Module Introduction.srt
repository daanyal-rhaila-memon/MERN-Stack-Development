1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,810
In this course you'll learn a lot about TypeScript and there is one particular use case one scenario

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,320
where you could all use typescript which we hadn't had a look at.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,160
Thus far we primarily focused on using typescript to write browser side JavaScript code in the end.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,070
And that is totally fine and might be the most common use case of working with typescript but it's not

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,880
the only one.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,440
You can also use typescript to build.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,690
Note J.S. applications although of course in conjunction with the popular express J as framework.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,450
Now while notorious on its own is not capable of executing typescript In this module you will learn

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:49,160
how you can still use typescript to write notorious scripts and we will build a very simple web application

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:57,020
a very simple REST API here where we also utilize typescript on the server side with no trace and express

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,880
just as in the react section.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,540
Here's a little disclaimer for this section this section here requires node and expressed knowledge.

13
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,350
It's about using typescript with node Express it's not teaching node from the ground up.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,830
So if you never heard about node and express before definitely take some dedicated resources like my

15
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,510
node J.S. to complete guide course first before you explore this section.

16
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,440
So let's dive in.
