1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,410
With a lot of the basics out of the way let's explore some advanced typing concepts now some advanced

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,640
concepts typescript offers to you that can become handy in certain situations.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:19,360
You might be facing in the projects you're working on in this module we'll have a look at a couple of

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,260
interesting concepts among them intersection types.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,700
What that is and why it might be useful.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,970
Type guards.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,460
What we can do with those discriminated unions fancy term for a quite interesting topic.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,820
We'll also have a look at type.

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,490
A useful feature for telling typescript about the type of something.

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,480
In cases where typescript is not able to find out which type something has on its own and we'll have

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,270
a look at function overload it's a pretty neat feature that allows us to write more flexible functions

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,290
with better typescript support than we might otherwise get it.
