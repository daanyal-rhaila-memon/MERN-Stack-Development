1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,610
And this is it for this module.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,850
We had a look at some advanced typescript features that can come in handy in applications and like with

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,180
all the other concepts you already learn about.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,410
Of course we will have a project where we see many of these things in action so that you don't just

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,180
learn them here in theory but you also see them applied in a real project.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,760
Nonetheless I hope the concepts taught here are pretty clear and dairy use as clear as well and why

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,650
you might want to use some of these patterns because features like intersection types function overloads

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:44,570
type guards in various variations with different approaches to find out which type something has that

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,450
discriminated union's pattern ends on.

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,510
These are all interesting patterns said can help you improve your code your code quality and make your

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,860
intentions clearer.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,010
Type costing can be super important to get proper types of support and make sure that you can really

13
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,320
work with types in the best possible way and get the best possible type checking.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,070
And with that let's move on to our modules and see what else typescript has in store for us.

15
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,250
As I mentioned will of course also see many of these concepts being applied in a real project and in

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,930
general throughout this course.
