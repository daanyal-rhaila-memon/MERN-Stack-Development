1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:09,340
Now in the last module we learned how to work with third party libraries in typescript and that's exactly

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,740
what we'll build up on this module.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:18,670
We will build a tiny application a very simple Web site where we will use third party libraries to send

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,930
HDP requests and also to render a map.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,700
With the help of google maps.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,710
So that is what we'll do.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,180
And of course we'll do all of this with typescript.
