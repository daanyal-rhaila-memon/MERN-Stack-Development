00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,640
For this attached you find this starting Project.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,270
It's a good old starting Project.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,590
We already know and they're in Apt.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,810
Yes we can write some code and index H Tim L..

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,000
Well we got basically nothing.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,830
Now my goal here is very simple.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,420
I want to build a simple web application where we can enter and address.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,950
Then I want to look up this address and convert it into a pair of coordinates and we'll do this with

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,210
help of Google with one of Google's API eyes.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,980
And then I want to render these coordinates.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:40,400
I want to show these coordinates on a map which we will also render with help of Google Maps or with

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:46,000
help of Google specifically with help of the Google Maps Javascript SDK.

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,700
So we'll be working with two third party libraries here.

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,740
This H to the PS sending library and the Google Maps library.

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,410
And with that I'd say let's get started and let's get started by building the very basic skeleton.

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:05,320
Now this is no H to mail and those styling cores so we'll keep this fairly simple.

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,390
All create a div here in index HDL which will get an idea of map.

18
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,070
My goal is to render the map in this div later.

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:22,720
Now in this div at the moment I'll add a paragraph where I say please enter an address so that we see

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,730
this paragraph whilst we haven't picked a place yet and below it is div.

21
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,410
I'll add a form without an action and without a method because I will handle it in typescript and in

22
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:46,660
this form I want to have a input of type text with an idea of address and below that a button of type

23
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:54,140
submit where I say search place or search address whatever you want to say.

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,620
And the goal is of course that when we submit this form we get the valued user entered here and then

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,460
we convert it into coordinates which we render here on the map.

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,700
Now let's add some styling because we need at least some basic styling and therefore I'll add a link

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,870
here and point at apt on CSX which is a file we have yet to add and then the C as this file I'll set

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,690
up some very simple styles for the map.

29
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,270
I'll give it the width of 90 percent and a height of let's say 20 REM so that we see something on the

30
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:33,460
screen a border of 1 pixel solid and a light grayish look a margin of 2 REM top and bottom and auto

31
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:40,390
left and right to center it and then it will use display flex and air to set up flex box where we can

32
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:47,050
use justified content center and a line items center to center does paragraph which is show initially

33
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:54,790
in the middle of this box I will also said text align to center so that the text in the paragraph also

34
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:02,060
is centered and with that forward of form we can also select this by the Forum tag here.

35
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:09,750
I also want to use text align center to center does all in the middle of the screen so to say give it

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,950
a margin of 2 REM and auto.

37
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,010
So to all have some spacing between the map and the form and Dad should be it on the page we should

38
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,710
now see something like this.

39
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,630
Now I want to change my my funds here.

40
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:32,040
So for the overall H H2 Mal selector I'll set the font family to sans serif but with that I'm good and

41
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,900
you can certainly style more.

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,330
You can certainly styled as input or add a button but I don't want to worry too much about the styling

43
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,820
part here instead I want to make sure that this works but feel free to of course improve the styling

44
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,050
here.

45
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,110
With that prepared however let's make sure that now we actually fetch whatever the user entered here

46
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,480
and looked it up with the help of Google.
