1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,870
You can search for a Google geo coding API and you will find the official geo coding API docs the geo

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,580
coding API is an open API which you can use to translate an address to a pair of coordinates or a pair

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,040
of coordinates to an address.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,150
Now here we want to do a look up where we provide an address.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,970
So does normal geo coding request here and get back coordinates.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:36,480
Now for that we can send the request to this you are El but we need an API key to do that and we can

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,430
get one for free.

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,380
All you need for that is a Google account and also a credit card.

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,140
Unfortunately you need debt.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,630
It will be free because there is a very generous free tier which you can use every month and we will

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,040
not exceed that free tier with what we are doing here.

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,770
But still you need a credit card to be able to use Google Maps features unfortunately if you don't have

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,670
such a credit card.

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,370
Unfortunately you can't use the API.

15
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,670
So create a Google account and then to get such an API key.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,510
Click on get started here and get started we'll take you to a page where you can tell Google which features

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,830
you want and we want the Places feature because that includes the geo coding API.

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,060
But we also want the maps feature because that will include these Google Maps Javascript SDK which we

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,280
need a little bit later.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,790
So check these two and then click continue.

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,170
Next you have to select a project for which you want to enable this and you can even create a new one

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,940
or pick an existing one once you do that.

23
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,440
You are for warded

24
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:56,070
and you should be asked whether you want to setup billing for this account simply confirmed as an after

25
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,990
a while of waiting and loading

26
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,560
you will be presented to your API key which you can use.

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,350
Side note You can also restrict the apps which are able to use that key in this Google developer console.

28
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,130
But here we can just copy that key and use it in our project so let's store that key maybe here in a

29
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,030
constant Google API key

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,690
and let's next focus on sending a request for that.

31
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,600
Let's again Google for Google geo coding API so that we get this you are El again here.

32
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:41,170
This year L is the U or L which we need to send the request and for that we need some way of sending

33
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,610
a request from inside our TypeScript and data for JavaScript code.
