1

00:00:02,140  -->  00:00:06,500
Now you can not only add one decorator, you can also add multiple.

2

00:00:06,500  -->  00:00:14,060
So let's say I also want to log this class, so I could use my logging decorator I pass through for example

3

00:00:14,150  -->  00:00:20,810
to then, as again this is a factory attach the logged function here as a decorator

4

00:00:20,820  -->  00:00:21,740
in the end

5

00:00:22,050  -->  00:00:25,880
and if I save this and reload my page,

6

00:00:26,330  -->  00:00:32,670
well now you see that yes we have the plant being printed here by the printable function

7

00:00:32,810  -->  00:00:39,950
but before that, we see the log logging the constructor function to the console and that stems from this

8

00:00:40,340  -->  00:00:43,400
logging decorator here.

9

00:00:43,970  -->  00:00:48,080
If I change this to false, the log decorator will not get attached

10

00:00:48,320  -->  00:00:54,650
and therefore if I reload this, we only see the plant printing itself due to the printable decorator but

11

00:00:54,650  -->  00:00:58,860
we don't see the constructor function being printed to the console before that

12

00:00:59,180  -->  00:01:03,210
and that's just because the logged decorator is not attached here.
