1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,430
So that was a lot of talking about decorators and functions,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,550
the key takeaway is a decorator is just a function, a normal function, any function could be a decorator

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,630
in theory but then it depends on where you want to attach this function as a decorator and what does

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,590
depend on that?

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,780
Well, which arguments can be used by this function.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,160
Then you simply attach a decorator with the @ sign and you can either directly attach the kind of final

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,020
decorator you want to use by leaving out the parentheses,

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,480
in this case you have to make sure that the parameters passed to the functions match the parameters

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:46,680
TypeScript will give you for this type of decorators, so a class decorator in this case. The alternative

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,830
way is to use a factory which you have to execute by adding parentheses and any potential arguments

11
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,030
you specified, you're totally free about which arguments you expect here

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,530
and this factory has to return a function which can be used as a decorator, which means a function with

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,670
the right parameters

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:16,370
again. Now you rightfully would ask, how do I know which parameters a function should get for the different

15
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,630
types of decorators? And now we only saw class decorators

16
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,050
but I'll soon dive into other types of decorators too

17
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,770
and yes of course, I will tell you all the arguments expected by TypeScript but if you want to look

18
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,670
it up and not really watch all the videos, the place to go is the typescriptlang.org page,

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,350
the official webpage of TypeScript and then the documentation, here the handbook

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:52,310
and then you got decorators. Now on these decorators, you will see a very good explanation of decorators,

21
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,810
so something to look up if you in doubt

22
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,350
and also on all types of decorators, for example method decorators, something I'll come to

23
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:07,510
next, you'll see which arguments this decorator expects listed here.

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,680
So that's just as a fallback for you to know where to look.
