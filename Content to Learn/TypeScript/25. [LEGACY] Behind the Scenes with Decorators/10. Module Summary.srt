1

00:00:01,820  -->  00:00:03,770
So that were decorators. 

2

00:00:03,770  -->  00:00:10,460
Decorators are really an interesting feature and they're in development, so we may see some additions

3

00:00:10,490  -->  00:00:12,790
or changes to them in the future,

4

00:00:13,010  -->  00:00:17,010
something of course I will inform you about in this course.

5

00:00:17,030  -->  00:00:25,310
Basically, decorators give you the ability to transform certain classes or add new data to it or add

6

00:00:25,310  -->  00:00:26,680
new information to it

7

00:00:26,690  -->  00:00:34,430
as you saw in this course or in this module. Decorators may also be used in conjunction with metadata

8

00:00:35,120  -->  00:00:40,730
and now metadata is something not really related to TypeScript, not introduced by TypeScript which is

9

00:00:40,730  -->  00:00:46,550
why I don't cover it specifically here but if you want to learn more about metadata and decorators

10

00:00:46,550  -->  00:00:53,300
and how you may use them together, definitely have a look at the official TypeScript webpage,

11

00:00:53,300  -->  00:00:54,660
typescriptlang.org 

12

00:00:54,860  -->  00:00:58,720
and there under documentation, handbook

13

00:00:59,230  -->  00:01:06,900
and here the decorators part. At the very bottom, you will learn more about how to add metadata with

14

00:01:06,900  -->  00:01:13,780
a decorator which might be interesting to you in your project too, just as what you could do next

15

00:01:13,790  -->  00:01:14,640
otherwise.

16

00:01:14,880  -->  00:01:15,820
Well with that,

17

00:01:15,880  -->  00:01:18,380
let's have a look at the next module in this course.
