00:00:01,580  -->  00:00:06,650
With interfaces and generics, we had a look at two new features introduced by TypeScript.

2

00:00:07,310  -->  00:00:10,900
TypeScript actually has a couple of new features,

3

00:00:10,910  -->  00:00:13,670
one of them being decorators,

4

00:00:13,820  -->  00:00:21,380
that is what we're going to have a look at it in this module. Basically decorators are functions you

5

00:00:21,380  -->  00:00:28,190
can attach to classes, to methods, to properties and then work with these classes,

6

00:00:28,190  -->  00:00:30,980
methods, properties or transform them.

7

00:00:31,190  -->  00:00:38,220
So it's kind of a bit of metaprogramming and you will see how all of that works throughout this module.

8

00:00:38,220  -->  00:00:45,980
Decorators basically gave you the chance of extending a class, of adding an extra functionality simply

9

00:00:45,980  -->  00:00:52,430
by adding a little thing which you will see in this module to it and then all of a sudden, introducing

10

00:00:52,430  -->  00:01:01,250
a whole lot of new functionality to a class for example or to a property simply by adding this

11

00:01:01,370  -->  00:01:03,140
thing, this decorator.

12

00:01:03,380  -->  00:01:08,240
Well let's leave the world of theory here and see it in action in the next lectures.
