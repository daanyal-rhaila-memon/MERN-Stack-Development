00:00:01,750  -->  00:00:05,650
Now in TypeScript, there also are some built-in generics,

2

00:00:05,650  -->  00:00:07,510
so let's have a look at them,

3

00:00:08,560  -->  00:00:13,750
the most prominent built-in generic probably is the array.

4

00:00:13,750  -->  00:00:19,660
So let's say we have some test results and they are stored in an array.

5

00:00:19,660  -->  00:00:23,780
Now of course we can simply create this array

6

00:00:23,830  -->  00:00:28,310
like so, for example I'll have two values in that array

7

00:00:28,780  -->  00:00:29,710
and that would work

8

00:00:29,800  -->  00:00:34,720
and there's nothing wrong with that but in the back,

9

00:00:34,720  -->  00:00:43,060
this is a generic type. So we can assign a type to this test results array and the type would be array

10

00:00:43,510  -->  00:00:49,460
and then assign which types this array should be able to hold.

11

00:00:49,750  -->  00:00:59,920
So now if I push a new item on that array, that works but if I try to push let's say a string,

12

00:01:00,190  -->  00:01:04,540
well my IDE is already complaining and so is TypeScript

13

00:01:04,540  -->  00:01:06,640
if I try to compile this.

14

00:01:06,820  -->  00:01:15,040
So by explicitly setting this type here, I'm getting the compiler support which makes sure that I'm not

15

00:01:15,040  -->  00:01:18,670
accidentally pushing something on that array which doesn't work.

16

00:01:19,150  -->  00:01:23,280
So with that, I can of course log that array and that will just work

17

00:01:23,350  -->  00:01:27,830
but now I explicitly set which values this array will be able to hold.

18

00:01:27,910  -->  00:01:33,280
Normally you can mix strings, numbers and whatever you want but if you want to be explicit and don't

19

00:01:33,280  -->  00:01:34,540
want to have them mixed,

20

00:01:34,600  -->  00:01:42,130
well this is how you would do that and with that, if I could go to the console, print it out, you see my

21

00:01:42,130  -->  00:01:49,360
array here with all numbers because I assigned it as this. So array is a generic type by default.
