We're staying in a world of new features and this module has a look at a very cool new features, generic

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:23,360
Generics as you will learn are a powerful tool to write really dynamic code, flexible code and use

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:31,320
both the power of TypeScript and the fact that it needs to know what type a certain property or variable

Let's have a look at it in this module.
