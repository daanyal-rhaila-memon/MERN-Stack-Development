00:00:01,830  -->  00:00:08,590
So we're done on generics. Now generics are a really cool feature but you're probably not using them

2

00:00:08,620  -->  00:00:15,190
all over the place simply because they're a really specific feature and oftentimes, you don't need to

3

00:00:15,190  -->  00:00:22,990
use them but you will know when to use them and then they really add extra flexibility and make your

4

00:00:22,990  -->  00:00:25,890
code more flexible or for you as a developer

5

00:00:25,900  -->  00:00:29,800
more flexibility. If you want to learn more about generics,

6

00:00:29,950  -->  00:00:38,530
well unfortunately the greatest hint or advice I can give to you is simply googling for generics because

7

00:00:38,560  -->  00:00:42,670
it's a concept not exclusively introduced by TypeScript,

8

00:00:42,700  -->  00:00:49,200
you will also find it in other languages and the idea behind it is always the same.

9

00:00:49,210  -->  00:00:55,480
So any article diving deeper into generics might be a great starting point to learn more about the theory

10

00:00:55,480  -->  00:00:57,820
behind them if you're interested in that.

11

00:00:58,000  -->  00:01:00,750
Well now with that, let's continue with the course.
