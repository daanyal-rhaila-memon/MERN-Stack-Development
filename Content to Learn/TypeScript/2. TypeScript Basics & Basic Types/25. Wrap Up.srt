1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,260
Now with that we had a thorough look at all the core types and the types good basics you hopefully now

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:16,090
understand how we create and the sign types how we assign types to variables and two parameters and

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,530
why we do that.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:17,890
How.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:24,810
Type assignments and types could differ from javascript type checks that JavaScript uses runtime types

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,480
and typescript uses static types that mattered during development that the built javascript code Dale

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,450
for does not include any type assignments.

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:40,980
It of course includes any type checks because dad is regular javascript code but something like this

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,310
year does is simply not allowed in JavaScript does not support its syntax.

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,670
That's typescript only so that's hopefully clear.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,270
And then we had a look at numbers strings boolean ends at function types and setting return types argument

12
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:02,090
types and also describing the type of an overall function which can be helpful if you want to have a

13
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,780
variable that eventually holds a function.

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,460
We had a look at objects and arrays and E numbers and how that can be interesting and help you the same

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,020
is true for tuples.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,180
And now we also had a look at aliases type aliases where you can merge complex types into aliases which

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,240
you can reuse.

18
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,350
We had a look at literal types and union types which can be useful for scenarios where you expect more

19
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,370
than one possible type.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,160
And now at the end we all had a look at unknown and never which are niche types but still in their niche

21
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,300
they can be very useful.

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,900
And now with these basics we'll dive deeper into individual aspects and of course also explore other

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,010
types and JavaScript constructs where typescript can be helpful.
