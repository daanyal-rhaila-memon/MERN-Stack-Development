1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,930
With that we're almost done with the Corps types.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,110
There is one more type which we already saw and that's the.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:15,160
Any type the any type is the most flexible type you can assign and typescript this type doesn't tell

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,730
typescript anything.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,980
It basically means you can store any kind of value in there.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,310
We got no specific type assignment typescript will basically never yell at you when you use any back

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,340
in our code here if I would set the type of favorite activities to any would not get an error if I said

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,650
it to any array.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,210
I at least tell typescript that favorite activities is an array of something.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,670
So if it would store just a single value in there I would get an error.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,210
But as long as it is an array I can store whatever I want in there.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,250
So any is really flexible and this can sound great at first but actually it's a big disadvantage and

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:01,330
you absolutely want to a white any whenever possible because any takes away basically all advantages

14
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:07,150
typescript gives you it gives you the same experience you have with vanilla javascript where you also

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:14,350
have to any type on everything so to say any basically make sure that the typescript compiler can't

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:22,720
check anything because if any property or any variable can store any value well then there's not much

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,180
to check right.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,810
So you can use any as a fallback if you have some value some kind of data where you really can't know

19
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,300
which kind of data will be stored in there and where you then maybe are using some runtime checks like

20
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,720
we did here at runtime to narrow down what you want to do for certain values then you could go with

21
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,410
any.

22
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:51,290
But in other cases you really won a wide any if you have a chance of knowing which kind of data you're

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,390
working with.

24
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,000
Be explicit about it.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,670
Let us type scripts inference do its job or explicitly set your own types don't fall back to any if

26
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,660
you don't need to.
