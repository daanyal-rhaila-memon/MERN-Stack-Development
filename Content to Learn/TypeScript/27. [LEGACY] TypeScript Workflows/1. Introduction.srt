00:00:01,850  -->  00:00:07,140
In the last module, we had a look at how to add third-party packages. In this module,

2

00:00:07,170  -->  00:00:15,570
I kind of want to stay in the world of TypeScript project management or projects, workflows and so

3

00:00:15,570  -->  00:00:16,180
on.

4

00:00:16,320  -->  00:00:23,850
We're going to have a look at how we may integrate TypeScript into various workflows, including a

5

00:00:23,880  -->  00:00:31,050
pure TypeScript compiler usage workflow where we only use the TypeScript compiler and see how we can configure

6

00:00:31,050  -->  00:00:35,760
that to work really nicely, how to integrate it in a Gulp workflow

7

00:00:35,790  -->  00:00:43,650
if you were to use Gulp as a builder tool or as a last option, how to integrate TypeScript with webpack

8

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:51,910
so that any of your projects under control of webpack could be enhanced by adding TypeScript to it.

9

00:00:51,960  -->  00:00:55,350
So let's have a look at these three options and how to use TypeScript there

10

00:00:55,380  -->  00:00:56,240
in this module.
