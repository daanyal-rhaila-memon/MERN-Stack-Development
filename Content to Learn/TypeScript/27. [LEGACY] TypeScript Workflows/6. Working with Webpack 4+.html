<p>If you're using Webpack 4.x (check the package.json file to find out which version was installed), you'll need a slightly different setup than shown in the next lecture.</p><p>Here are the adjustments you'll have to put into place:</p><p>1. Change loaders to rules.</p><p>2. In extensions[0] to "*" from "".</p><p>It's also suggested to keep the filename as ./bundle.js as a dist folder is added automatically.
</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">module.exports = {
    entry:"./app.ts",
    output: {
        filename:"./bundle.js"
    },
    devtool:"source-map",
    resolve: {
        extensions: ["*",".ts",".tsx",".js"]
    },
    module:{
        rules: [
            {test:/\.tsx?$/, loader:"ts-loader"}
        ]
    }
};
</pre><p>When running Webpack, you probably get an error:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">The CLI moved into a separate package: webpack-cli.
Please install 'webpack-cli' in addition to webpack itself to use the CLI.
-&gt; When using npm: npm install webpack-cli -D
-&gt; When using yarn: yarn add webpack-cli -D
</pre><p>Simply install webpack-cli, thereafter it should work:</p><p><code>npm install webpack-cli --save-dev</code> </p><p><br></p>
