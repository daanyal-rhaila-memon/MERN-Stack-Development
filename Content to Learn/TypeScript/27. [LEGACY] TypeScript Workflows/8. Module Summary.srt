00:00:01,910  -->  00:00:09,150
So now you learned how to add TypeScript to various set ups and how to integrate it into workflows.

2

00:00:09,220  -->  00:00:15,890
Now of course, all the workflows shown in this module were rather basic and I always focused on the

3

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:21,920
TypeScript part obviously because there are one million of possible workflows,

4

00:00:22,010  -->  00:00:27,670
it depends on your preferences, on what else you use in your project and so on.

5

00:00:28,010  -->  00:00:32,640
But generally, integrating TypeScript always works like that

6

00:00:32,840  -->  00:00:39,020
and with the knowledge gained in this module, you should be able to implement TypeScript in your more

7

00:00:39,050  -->  00:00:44,940
advanced workflow or at least you should know how to get started with implementing it there.
