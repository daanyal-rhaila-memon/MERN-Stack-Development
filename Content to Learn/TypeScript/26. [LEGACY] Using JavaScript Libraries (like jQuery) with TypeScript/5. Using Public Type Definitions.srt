1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,230
So you learned about these declaration files which you could write on your own

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,710
but of course we don't want to write them on our own,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,690
instead we can install the ones which were written by the community where you can contribute

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,760
but which you can also just consume. And for that, we'll need npm,

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,660
so make sure you install NodeJS to have that npm, that Node Package Management tool installed too

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:30,500
and then in the project folder, run npm init and answer all these questions with the default value. Then

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,700
you'll get this package.json

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,230
file and now you can install other packages with the npm install command.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:44,910
And there I will install with --save-dev to mark it as a development-only dependency, the @types

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,430
and then the name of the library name,

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,550
so here, JQuery. So with npm install --save-dev @types/jquery,

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,980
I installed a type definition in the latest version for that JQuery package

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,960
and here we see an entry in the dev dependencies of the package.json file.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,110
The cool thing is that the TypeScript compiler will automatically without any extra configuration

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:17,970
consider all these @types, so everything in the types folder, in the node_modules folder and will include

16
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,910
them. So it will automatically dive into that JQuery folder and include the type definition files in

17
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,190
there without us telling it to the compiler and therefore now if I repeat

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,050
tsc, this still compiles but now with these detailed type definitions installed. We don't just have the compilation

19
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,430
work again, which we had before too

20
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,730
but you can see in the IDE here,

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,660
I get way better support now,

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:51,330
I get autocompletion because now my IDE fully understands what's behind that dollar sign function because

23
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,720
TypeScript now fully understands it. And this is the way to go

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,290
and this is what I strongly recommend doing when you use third-party libraries which are not written

25
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,520
in TypeScript.

26
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,780
You should then install the respective type definitions which are available for basically every library

27
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,650
that is at least a bit more important and popular. JQuery has it and a lot of other popular Javascript

28
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,280
libraries also have their own type definitions.
