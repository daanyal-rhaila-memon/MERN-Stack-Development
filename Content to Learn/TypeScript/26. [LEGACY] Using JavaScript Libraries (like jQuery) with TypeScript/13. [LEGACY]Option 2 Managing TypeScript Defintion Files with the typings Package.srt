1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:07,220
If you create a project with loads of Javascript libraries, you probably don't want to copy and paste

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,570
all these definition files by hand,

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,740
also if you share it, you have to share all these files

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,620
and it's not doing the best or most convenient way.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,380
So let's have a look at a great alternative to this approach.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,830
There is actually a third-party package which you can install globally on your machine which handles

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,140
all these file downloading and creation for you,

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:39,590
it's named typings and you can install it by installing it globally on your machine with npm install

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,340
-g typings, on Mac

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,590
you will need to add a sudo in front of it.

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,830
Now here, I'll quickly enter my password and then this will download this typings package for me which is

12
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:59,420
a package manager allowing me to download various typings or definition files as we just did it

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,590
manually,

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,030
let's see how it works.

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,580
So I'll first get rid of this jquery.d.ts file here as I don't need it anymore

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,150
and next, I want to use typings to get it back.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,620
So I run typings

18
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:23,770
since I installed it globally and then I have to run install and now JQuery because that is what

19
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,080
this is named, though that won't work,

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,720
we have to fetch it from the definitelytyped repository and therefore we have to write dt~jquery,

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,920
just keep that in mind.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,310
If you want to download a file from the definitelytyped repository and that is the biggest repository

23
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,330
for definitely or for type definition files I know,

24
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,410
then you have to use this dt~ part in front of the name of the package you want to download.

25
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:58,230
Now with that, I'll add the --global flag to make it available globally in this project, this does

26
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:04,440
not mean that it gets installed globally on your machine, only that every file in your project will have

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:13,200
access to it and then --save to create a JSON file which holds a reference to this package,

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,900
so that if we share this project, we only have to share this JSON file and everyone else is then

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,140
able to just run typings install to install all the dependencies mentioned in this file, just like you

30
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,110
have package.json file for your project dependencies.

31
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,280
So let's hit enter and it's done,

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,610
it created this typings folder and this typings.json folder.

33
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,400
Now as I mentioned this JSON folder or this JSON file here excuse me simply holds a reference to this

34
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:50,380
JQuery dependency or this JQuery file and in the typings file folder,

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,580
we actually got this JQuery file added to it.

36
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,810
So this is the same file we manually downloaded in the last lecture.

37
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,170
Now with this installed, if I recompile my project, the error is gone too.

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,120
So here again we don't have to add any import,

39
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,850
it works automatically on its own simply by adding this typings.json file or this typings folder

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,660
then specifically automatically through the typings tool.

41
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:24,110
So that is the alternative to the other approach which is extremely convenient especially if you've

42
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,100
got multiple dependencies or multiple Javascript packages you're using.
