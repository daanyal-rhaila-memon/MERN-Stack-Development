1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,440
With TypeScript 2.0, a nice alternative to using the typings package was added.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:15,470
You can still use it as you learned it but TypeScript 2.0 now has a built-in typings manager which is

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,040
an awesome new feature to be honest.

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,920
So what you can do here is you can simply get rid of the typings.json file, also of the typings folder

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,940
if you already installed your typings, here I just start a new project which is why you would see

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,900
this folder

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:36,660
and now of course we encountered the issue that if we compile this, we're not aware of dollar sign,

8
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,510
we don't know what JQuery is.

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,780
Now all we have to do with the built-in typings manager is we have to run npm install,

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:53,180
so we use npm now to manage our typings, like we use it to manage all other packages which is the great

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:59,420
thing about this, --save development as we want to add them as a development dependency

12
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:08,300
and then this is important, @types, this is kind of the overall package used by the TypeScript company

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:15,470
or compiler here to manage all the times or get access to all the types and then the name of the types

14
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,430
package.

15
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,660
Now here's an important thing,

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,150
we're still using definitelytyped which you saw in the other videos,

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,810
so this big Github repository.

18
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,000
We're still talking about the community managed types here,

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,150
these are no type packages or declarations managed by the TypeScript team,

20
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,950
instead they just provide us an easier access to this big Github repository.

21
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,720
Therefore the names after the slash here stay the same, though we don't have to use

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,540
dt~ anymore,

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,140
we can just use types

24
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:53,300
and then in this case, JQuery. Now this will pull down JQuery type declaration files and add them to our

25
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,780
package.json as well and of course is the more important part to our node_modules which we can

26
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,960
check here,

27
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,810
here we see the types folder and we see the JQuery type here.

28
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:12,410
Now the great thing is, again this is managed here in our package, in our package.json file to

29
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,200
be precise,

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,790
here you can see this new entry which allows us to quickly reinstall it if we share our project here

31
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,690
without the node_modules folder or what you typically do. Now with this

32
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:30,590
if I run tsc again, you see the error is gone and now we recognize the dollar sign because the cool

33
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,890
thing is that the TypeScript compiler is aware of this new mechanism,

34
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:42,690
so it will automatically search for imports like this one which it doesn't know or for types it doesn't know

35
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,020
in the node_modules @types folder.

36
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,940
So all this is done automatically,

37
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,820
we don't have to do anything here

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,940
and with that, we don't have to use another package like the typings package anymore,

39
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,570
we can use npm only. Of course

40
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,570
and this is important,

41
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,530
you may still use typings,

42
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,290
there's nothing wrong with it but this is the faster way and it uses the same repository.
