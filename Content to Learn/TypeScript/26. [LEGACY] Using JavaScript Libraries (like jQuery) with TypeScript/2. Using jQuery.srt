00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,330
So as I mentioned in the last lecture, here I'm in the empty folder opened in Visual

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,910
Studio Code, my IDE

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,150
and now let's say here we have a normal project with an index.html file with a normal HTML5 skeleton,

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,800
TypeScript and third-party libraries and

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:24,800
now in here,

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,520
let's say I want to use the JQuery library.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,210
So on jquery.com, what I normally would do when I want to use it, I click on download

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:39,400
and now we can download it and add it to our project or we use one of the CDN links to basically pull

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,030
it in from a server, from another server where it's hosted and here I'll just take the minified version

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,850
of the latest JQuery version and at this point of time, copy that script tag and add this in the body section

11
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,480
here of my index.html file.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,670
So now I'm importing this JQuery script and of course this is Javascript, this is not in TypeScript

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,120
format.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:08,260
Now let's say of course we also write our own app logic and we do this here in the app.ts file or whatever

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,360
you want to call it, here I will be using TypeScript

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,040
and here I will simply import that

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,580
but of course there I will also import app.js

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,100
because the goal is to compile that.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,380
Now let's create a very simple application here with a button which says Click Me and my simple goal

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:33,540
is to now select this button with the help of JQuery and then do something, throw an alert whenever

21
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,190
we click this button.

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,100
Now with JQuery, with normal JQuery what we can do is we can add this, now just temporarily,

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,300
add a Javascript script here,

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,640
in this case I'm doing this inline in the index.html file, I'll change this later

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,160
and then I will just use this dollar sign which is made available by JQuery,

26
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,810
this is just a function.

27
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:02,010
We pass a CSS selector like the button selector and JQuery then gives us the click method

28
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,440
we can call to define a function that should be executed

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:13,640
when a click on this button occurs and there I can throw an alert, button was clicked.

30
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,470
Now this is not using TypeScript here of course, this is just Javascript but with that, I can now double-click

31
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:26,250
that index.html file to run this and on the running page if I click this button, I see this alert,

32
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:34,350
so this works but this is as I mentioned normal Javascript. When I copy that code and I move that into

33
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,700
my app.ts file here

34
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,920
and then here I'm using the terminal integrated into my IDE,

35
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,890
I simply run tsc --init to turn this into a TypeScript project with a tsconfig and

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:56,480
now what we will see if I add the no emit on error key here in the tsconfig and set this to

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,190
true so that we don't generate a Javascript file,

38
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,240
we have an error

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,320
and I already see it in my IDE too that it complains

40
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:11,590
but now if I were to run tsc in this project folder, I indeed get an error here that this dollar sign

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,740
thing is basically not known or that it can't find this. And this makes sense because we never defined

42
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,440
dollar sign as a method,

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,320
we have no method in here that would tell TypeScript what this is all about and therefore it complains,

44
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,320
even though we know that this code would run but TypeScript doesn't know that.
