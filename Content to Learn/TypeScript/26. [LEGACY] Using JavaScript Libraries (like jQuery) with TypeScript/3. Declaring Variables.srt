1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,820
So TypeScript doesn't understand this dollar sign method here is made available globally because we

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,720
added our JQuery import here. Now

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,210
to inform TypeScript that this is available,

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,830
we've got a couple of ways of doing so.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:26,500
The easiest fix which you can always use if you have a global method or variable of which you know

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,770
that it exists but TypeScript doesn't know it, you can use the declare keyword in your TypeScript file

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,050
where you will use that unknown function or variable, then var and then the name of that function or

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,600
variable,

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,440
no matter what it is, you always use declare var and then you simply give this a type of any, that is the

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,490
simplest way of making this work.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,220
As you see, the error is now gone

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,850
and now when I run tsc again, it compiled successfully and it gives us this app.js file.

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:06,010
Now this is a cheap way of making this work but it is a way you can definitely use if you have no other

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,410
way

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:13,660
or if you just want to get it to work quickly. But it's not an ideal way because with this line here,

16
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:20,000
we almost pass no information at all to TypeScript about this dollar sign variable,

17
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,330
it doesn't even know whether it's a function or not, leave alone that it would know what we can do

18
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,100
with the result of this function.

19
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,130
So for example here, that we can call click on the result of this function call, TypeScript doesn't know

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,720
that because we only tell it

21
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,110
this can be anything

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,790
and therefore here I get no IDE support at all,

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,710
we get no warnings and we get no help because we don't give any useful information to TypeScript.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,340
So this is an approach we can use if we got no other alternative but there are better ways of solving

25
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,610
this.
