1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,660
A great alternative

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:09,340
and actually the way to do it is that there are people who already wrote such libraries and you can

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,980
find those libraries on definitelytyped.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:20,320
So simply search for definitelytyped and you should find this Github repository which is named

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,240
definitelytyped.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:29,050
There you will find thousands of Javascript packages which were kind of converted to TypeScript

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,620
in a sense of the translation file was written.

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,350
Now here you could basically scroll until you find JQuery but that is probably not the

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:38,880
way you want to do it,

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,080
a better way is simply to search for

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:53,380
definitelytyped and then JQuery and then you should find the respective page on this Github repository.

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,240
Now here, we have such a jquery.d.ts file which is the translation I was talking about.

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:07,570
If we have a look at it, we see how the creators of this file tried or did actually recreate JQuery or

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,850
create a translation for JQuery,

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,970
how it would look like in TypeScript.

16
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,490
Now what we can do is we can access the raw file here,

17
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,810
copy all of that, go back to our project and create a new file here

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,950
and let's name it jquery.d.ts, like so.

19
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,400
And in this file, I'll simply paste into it

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,930
the code I just copied from the definitelytyped repository.

21
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,000
Now with this pasted into here, let's try it again and run tsc

22
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,310
and as you see, the error is gone.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,090
Notice, I didn't add any import,

24
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,430
I still only have my JQuery import here, so TypeScript is clever enough to automatically find

25
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,840
this file and then read it and learn how JQuery works which also gives me the advantage

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,210
that now, I get support by my IDE here which of course depends on your IDE

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,710
if you got this or not.

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,710
So that's the quick way to get in such a JQuery definition file or any definition file in general.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,740
Now let's see which alternatives we have.
