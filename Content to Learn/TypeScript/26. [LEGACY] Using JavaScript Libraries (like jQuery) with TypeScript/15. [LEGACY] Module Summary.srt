Great. 

2

00:00:02,450  -->  00:00:09,920
So now you're able to implement any third-party libraries written in Javascript not in TypeScript into your

3

00:00:09,920  -->  00:00:14,690
TypeScript project and still benefit from TypeScript strengths.

4

00:00:15,020  -->  00:00:22,640
That was a key step to really now enable you to create your own more complex projects since you're no

5

00:00:22,640  -->  00:00:30,230
longer limited by the issue that once we add other third-party libraries to it, you'll lose a lot of the

6

00:00:30,230  -->  00:00:33,120
strengths TypeScript would have offered to you.

7

00:00:33,150  -->  00:00:39,840
Now you're back in the TypeScript is awesome world whilst at the same time, using third-party packages

8

00:00:39,850  -->  00:00:40,040
.
