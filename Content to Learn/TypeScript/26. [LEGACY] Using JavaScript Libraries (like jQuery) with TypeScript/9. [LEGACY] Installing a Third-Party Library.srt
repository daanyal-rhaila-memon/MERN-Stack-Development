00:00:02,100  -->  00:00:06,360
Now as mentioned, sometimes you want to add your own packages to your TypeScript

2

00:00:06,390  -->  00:00:10,950
projects and these packages may only be available as JavaScript. In this module,

3

00:00:10,950  -->  00:00:16,440
I'll have the example of JQuery, let's say in our TypeScript project which is not very awesome since

4

00:00:16,440  -->  00:00:22,800
we don't have a single line of code but let's say here we want to use JQuery, we want to use it to do

5

00:00:22,800  -->  00:00:24,780
something with the DOM and stuff you do with 

6

00:00:24,780  -->  00:00:25,750
JQuery.

7

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:29,170
The first step of course is to install JQuery,

8

00:00:29,340  -->  00:00:32,070
so I'll go down to my console here and I'll do that.

9

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:36,270
Now important to recognize this in my base project here,

10

00:00:36,270  -->  00:00:38,290
I already got a package.json file,

11

00:00:38,290  -->  00:00:42,460
I got my tsconfig file and all of these are very simple.

12

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:48,120
Here I only have the lite-server and SystemJS which is responsible for loading my modules even

13

00:00:48,120  -->  00:00:49,770
though I don't have modules here

14

00:00:49,920  -->  00:00:55,750
but you'll see why er'll use it here later on because we'll need to import JQuery then basically

15

00:00:55,770  -->  00:01:01,590
but before importing, let's install it. Now since I already got my package.json, I can use npm install

16

00:01:02,100  -->  00:01:08,670
and then --save to install it as a production dependency and then JQuery. This will

17

00:01:08,700  -->  00:01:12,540
download JQuery and install it into my node_modules folder.
