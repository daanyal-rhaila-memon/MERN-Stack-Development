1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:10,420
And one better way to solve this which my IDE even suggests here is to install a so-called type definitions.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,810
Type definitions is a feature TypeScript offers and you can learn more about that in the official documentation

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,910
under declaration files.

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,380
You can basically add your own declaration files which hold no script logic but which hold type and

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,700
function and so on definitions which TypeScript automatically considers when compiling your code.

6
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:42,080
So for example here, we could add a jquery.d.ts file and it has to be a .d.ts file for declaration

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,190
TypeScript file, TypeScript will look for files ending with .d.ts and in that file, you could

8
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,400
repeat that declare var dollar sign anything and what you will notice is that the error is now gone

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,840
in app.ts,

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,980
even though I commented it out here but implicitly, TypeScript automatically includes all .d.ts

11
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:10,370
file in its compilation step and therefore when I run tsc again here, it still works because it automatically

12
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,280
considers that file.

13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:18,710
Now of course, we didn't add more than we had before, we just outsourced this line here into its own separate

14
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,370
file

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,520
but it's important to know that TypeScript considers such files because of course, you can define more

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,600
complex statements than just a single line

17
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,610
and actually, this is an advanced feature which you mostly only need when you create libraries you want

18
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,250
to share with other people on your own but you can write quite advanced type definitions and you'll learn

19
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:47,000
more about that here in the official docs where you learn how you can declare that something is not

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,810
just anything but a number

21
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,570
or that it is a function

22
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,850
and what this function would return and so on and other people already did that for JQuery

23
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:04,490
and a lot of other popular Javascript libraries. If you search for definitelytyped JQuery and you can

24
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,360
plugin any library name you're looking for,

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:16,000
you should find this definitelytyped Github repository here and in there if you click on that, you find

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,240
type definitions for JQuery

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,620
and if you click on that jquery.d.ts file here and it's actually also used in conjunction with a couple

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,570
of other files,

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,760
there you see an interface is defined and you see a lot of example code in there

30
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,860
but if you would go through and it's quite a long file,

31
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:41,390
you'll see that for example that an add method is defined and so on and you will also find that click method definition

32
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,560
in there if you search through that file.

33
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:51,090
There are a lot of examples but eventually you'll also find the function definition of click in there.

34
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:57,830
So in the end, this file adds all the logic, here it is by the way, adds all the logic you need to add

35
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:07,250
to make TypeScript fully aware of what's behind that dollar sign variable and behind the object this

36
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,180
function we can call there returns for example

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,670
and therefore I can now remove that jquery.d.ts file

38
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:19,730
and now we can simply install these type definitions with the help of npm and for that, I'll quickly

39
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:27,020
run npm init to turn this into a project that has a package.json file and where we can use npm,

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,790
this Node Package Manager to install third-party packages

41
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,870
and for this to work by the way, you need to have NodeJS installed in its latest version,

42
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,500
not because we'll write NodeJS code but because we'll use the Node Package Manager that ships together

43
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,250
with Node.

44
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,300
Now let's do that in the next lecture.
