00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,960
Well we already covered a lot of features and how to use them in TypeScript.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,070
Now often times, you won't have a pure TypeScript project simply because you're not only writing your

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,030
own code but you may use a third-party package,

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,840
let's say JQuery.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,520
Now these packages tend to be written in Javascript, not in TypeScript

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,940
which means if you import them, well all of a sudden you lose the typings and so on for a big chunk

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,570
of your project, namely for all the JQuery related code in this example.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,750
Now to reintroduce these features, to make sure you're using the right types in conjunction with JQuery

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:52,560
or whatever your package is, we would need some way to get that information. Throughout this module,

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,570
you will learn how to combine your Javascript packages or third-party libraries with TypeScript and

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,780
create a nice translation for the TypeScript compiler to use to know which types

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,820
for example JQuery would use if it were written in TypeScript.

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,360
Now that's an amazing feature enabling you to have all the power of TypeScript available even when working

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,760
with non-TypeScript libraries.

15
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,370
Let's see how that works in this module.
