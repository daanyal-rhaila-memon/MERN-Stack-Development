00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,010
So in this module, you learned that

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,440
you can make normal third-party libraries like JQuery work in your TypeScript code by installing

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,510
the fitting type definitions.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,490
You also learned about a quicker hack

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,240
in case you just want to make the compilation work

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:25,060
but if you want full IDE suport and full TypeScript support, then you should install these type definitions

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,420
with the @types package and then the name of the library you want to install which implicitly then use

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,820
the types defined in this definitelytyped repository I showed you.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,630
And this allows you to make any Javascript library work in your TypeScript project.
