1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:09,530
Now with JQuery installed, I can go into my index.html or where I'm already at and here I want to add a

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,660
little div with an ID of app which I want to change through JQuery.

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:20,050
So here, just enter change it with JQuery so that we can see something on the screen

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:26,820
and then in my app.ts file, I want to use my JQuery code, like we know to use it with the dollar sign

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,140
and I'll ignore that my IDE marks it as red for now,

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,860
then I select the element with the app ID,

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,740
so basic JQuery here

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,750
and then I want to change the CSS styles.

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:47,450
So here, I'll pass a Javascript object and I want to change the background color to let's say green, of course

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,240
choose anything you like here.

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:01:00,790
Now what this should do is that as soon as I compile my code with tsc, it should allow me to see my application

12
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,610
with this changed background color.

13
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,250
Now right away we see that we get an error here, that the dollar sign isn't found

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,730
and how would we find it, TypeScript has

15
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,150
no chance of knowing what the dollar sign should refer to.

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,550
Well let's give it a try anyways and simply run our lite-server, npm start and see what we can find on

17
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,740
the web page,

18
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,390
well I only see change it with JQuery but no color.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,900
Well it's not that surprising because first, we're not recognizing the dollar sign but we're not even

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,980
trying to import JQuery here,

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,160
we installed it in the node_modules folder but that doesn't mean that it automatically gets added to our

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,330
application.

23
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,100
We don't have a script import here in the index.html file

24
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,970
and we could add one but to stay in the TypeScript world, let's instead use import statement here

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,430
and let's try importing JQuery, something like that,

26
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,630
maybe this works.

27
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,520
So let me open up a new terminal here and run tsc again,

28
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,540
of course we still get the error,

29
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,310
maybe it changed though.

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,800
No, not really.

31
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:14,220
Well let's see if we get some errors here in the console and we do, that our SystemJS module loader

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,440
has problems loading the Javascript file, the JQuery Javascript file.

33
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,430
As you can see here, it's looking for JQuery.js in our root directory

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,210
and the reason why it's looking there is that we're importing just JQuery here which of course refers

35
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,540
to JQuery.js then and to our root folder, though both isn't true.

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,620
Let's first see where JQuery actually lives,

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,920
in the node_modules file, let's locate it here,

38
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,890
so that's the JQuery folder we downloaded.

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,930
Now in here, we get this dist folder which probably holds the files we should import and there, we get the

40
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,730
jquery.min.js file where which looks like the bundle version we might want.

41
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,680
So it's in node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js,

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,590
that would be the path we can throw into our index.html file

43
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:14,100
but again, I want to use SystemJS here to manage all my dependencies and files and therefore here,

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,510
I can simply add a new config,

45
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,590
I can add the map configuration.

46
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,020
Now of course, this is no SystemJS course and if you want to learn more about SystemJS and

47
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,540
the available configurations, check out the official documentation.

48
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:36,780
What map allows you is to use any of your imports like JQuery here and map it against a real path.

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,170
If you don't have map, then it will try to resolve it on its own which as you saw before doesn't work

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,270
in this case.

51
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:52,380
So here, what I have to enter on my map key is a Javascript object where I then map JQuery and

52
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,950
this path or this part here, this key has to match whatever you're entering here in your import,

53
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,260
so you can name this whatever you want but then you have to match it here.

54
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,240
So this should match

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,720
and now here the path where to look for it.

56
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,990
Now the path will be node_modules

57
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,380
jquery/dist/

58
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,680
jquery.min.js, that's the path or the file

59
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,870
we just located. Now with that in place, if we have a look at the server,

60
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,420
oh we see it's working,

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,380
so it is green,

62
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,780
we do find the file, though we still have the issue that if I run tsc, we're getting this

63
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,130
compilation error.

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,790
So somehow the code is working but we still have this error.

65
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,390
Now how does this make sense?
