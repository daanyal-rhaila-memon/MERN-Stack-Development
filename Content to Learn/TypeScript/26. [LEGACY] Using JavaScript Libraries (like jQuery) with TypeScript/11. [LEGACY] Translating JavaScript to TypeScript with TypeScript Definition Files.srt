00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,270
It makes sense if you keep in mind that TypeScript compiles your file anyways but gives you these errors

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,820
and then here, it still doesn't know about that

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,200
but it compiles it and says basically well, if you know what you're doing, maybe it works and it does

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,190
work but it would be nice to not get this error and to get TypeScript to know JQuery which would also

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,980
give us other advantages of not only less errors

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,970
and these can quite add up if you have multiple JQuery commands but also in our IDE, some support

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and so on.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,970
So how do we tell TypeScript about JQuery?

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:46,650
We have to create a definition file for it which is basically a bridge between Javascript packages and

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,780
TypeScript.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,450
Pure Javascript packages of course don't have types, don't have many of the features TypeScript has but

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:01,770
you can create some translation files which don't hold any TypeScript code which gets executed but just

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,410
some translations from Javascript to TypeScript and TypeScript can read those files to then learn

14
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:14,100
what the Javascript package would look like if it were written in TypeScript. Such a definition

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:22,770
file has the ending, .d.ts and on the official TypeScript manual, under handbook,

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,790
you can read more about it in the writing declaration files section.

17
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,210
This explains how to write such a file and how it works and basically as I just said, you use multiple

18
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,800
TypeScript constructs there but only kind of create the types,

19
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,470
you don't write any functions which would get executed or something like that,

20
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,360
you only declare which type a variable has, how an interface should look like,

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,610
which classes these

22
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,170
Javascript package you would use if it were written in TypeScript and so on.

23
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:02,670
As you can imagine, that's quite a lot of work for a big library like JQuery and I certainly don't want

24
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,980
to do this on my own.

25
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,380
So let's look for some alternatives.
