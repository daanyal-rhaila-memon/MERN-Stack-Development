00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:08,380
Now throughout this course, you learned a lot about the different types we can use in TypeScript and how we can use

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,510
TypeScript to enhance our projects in general.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:20,170
Now there certainly are projects though where you use some third-party libraries which don't use TypeScript

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,600
which are not written in TypeScript,

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:31,000
so how can you now use such normal Javascript libraries in your TypeScript project and still take advantage

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,800
of all these type definitions and the enhanced IDE support and so on?

7
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,690
Now this is what we'll have a look at in this module and now just to avoid confusion,

8
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,930
I'm using a new editor here because this section here was basically recorded after I initially recorded

9
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,840
the course, it's an updated section and therefore here, I am using Visual Studio Code,

10
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,580
it's a normal code editor, normal IDE,

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,430
here I got an open empty folder

12
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,010
and this is where I will work in,

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,940
you can use any IDE to follow along of course.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,070
And now with that let's dive in and let's see an example of when we might have an issue when we use a normal

15
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,250
Javascript library and how we can then fix this issue.
