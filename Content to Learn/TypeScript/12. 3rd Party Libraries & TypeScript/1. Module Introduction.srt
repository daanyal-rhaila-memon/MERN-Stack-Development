00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,970
In modern web development we typically also work with third party libraries.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,970
We don't write all the code of our projects on our own.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:17,540
Instead typically we utilize third party libraries so that we don't always have to reinvent the wheel

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,620
on our own but can add certain functionalities to our projects and then just focus on our core business

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,630
logic.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,030
Now in this module we will have a look at third party libraries and how you can add them to your typescript

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:39,530
project and specifically we'll have a look at two types of libraries and what working with them in a

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,190
typescript project means we'll have a look at normal libraries which you could use in regular jobs good

9
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,420
projects as well and you will learn how you can use them in typescript and get the most out of them.

10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,900
But then we will also have a look at some typescript specific libraries.

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,210
The difference will be that these are libraries that really utilize and embrace certain types of features

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,710
to give you a brand new way of working with them to give you a certain functionalities.

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,510
You can't build like this with vanilla javascript so let's have a look at both.

14
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,430
In this module.
