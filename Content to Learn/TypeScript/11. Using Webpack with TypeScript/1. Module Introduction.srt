00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:09,890
In the previous modules we worked on a project and dear we ever had all our code in one file which made

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:16,910
it hard to manage or we actually split it into multiple files either by using name spaces or by using

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,340
these iOS 6 modules.

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:26,630
But when using iOS 6 modules whilst our code was more manageable we actually had another disadvantage

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:33,200
into which I'll dive again in this module again in this module will not also have a look at that disadvantage

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,870
again.

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,660
More importantly we'll have a look at a solution Westpac.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:45,170
So in this module you will learn what exactly web Peg is and of course stand we'll also use it to get

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:52,880
a set up a project setup which gives us the best of all worlds actually where we can write code split

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,550
up into multiple files without that disadvantage.

11
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,470
Add which will have a look at now.
