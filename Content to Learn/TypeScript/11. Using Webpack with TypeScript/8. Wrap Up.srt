00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:08,380
So we added Webb pack a very important tool that allows us to bundle together our different files into

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,700
one bundle.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,530
This really helps us decrease the amount of hp requests made and therefore can speed up our application.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,880
If you find yourself working with a lot of individual files what you typically do in bigger projects

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,670
tools like pick are a must use and webpage is the most important and prominent tool that helps you with

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,190
that.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,090
So therefore it's the tool I wanted to show here.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,670
You see that webpage is highly configurable and as I mentioned multiple times the official docs of webpage

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,610
are the place to go to learn all about it about different loaders different other settings you can set

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,830
up and how it works in general.

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,440
So definitely dive into this documentation if you want to become a webpage monster and you want to have

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,810
a more elaborate setup.

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:59,130
Our basic set up here however already allows us to compile type files with the Web pack and then bundle

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:06,370
to gather all the output into one single bundle jazz file and we also set up a configuration for development

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:13,120
which makes debugging easier and gives us more helpful error messages and we get a production setup

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,270
which gives us a highly optimized code which we then could deploy to a server to ship as little code

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,200
as possible to it and that's it.

18
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:28,420
Web Peg really is a core tool and being able to use it and having a configuration that really just works

19
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,180
is super important.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,950
So it is a must use in any modern project.

21
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,620
I would say and in this module you learned how you can get started with it in your types good projects.
