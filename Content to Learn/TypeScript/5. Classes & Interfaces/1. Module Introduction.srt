00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,130
In this module let's dive into classes and interfaces.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,910
Now the concept of classes might not totally be new to you.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:17,050
Classes also exist in vanilla javascript in modern vanilla javascript at least.

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:23,050
But if you haven't really worked with modern javascript then you might not know classes or if you're

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,560
relatively new to jobs so you might also not know about them yet.

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,880
So I'll introduce you to classes in this module as well and entirely new in JavaScript world at least

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,550
our interfaces.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,750
So in this module we'll explore what these things are and why we use them.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,140
Then we'll have a detailed look at classes and they are all that our concept called inheritance and

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,880
add interfaces what they bring to the table how they're compile to JavaScript and why we might use these

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,570
features.
