00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,150
Now to get started I want to make sure that I don't have to rerun this command here.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:15,160
This TSC command we're at point at a file after every change I make because right now whenever I change

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:24,580
something here in my typescript file and a one hour reflect that in my output file and on this Web page

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:35,470
here we have to save to file run the compilation again and then reload this file or if we have our NPM

5
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,730
start process running which we should have that at least our browser will automatically reload if we

6
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,110
don't directly open the file but instead are on low closed three thousand.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,260
But nonetheless even though with that reloading automatically we still have to manually rerun the compilation

8
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,740
command.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,660
So to get rid of that we can enter watch mode.

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:05,040
That means we can tell typescript to watch file and whenever that file changes typescript will recompile.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,210
So for that we can still run the same command but now we add dash dash watch at the end or just single

12
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,910
dash w if we do that then we are in watch mode on that file.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,300
And now whenever we change anything in there and we save that so that the file on the disk technically

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,650
changes as well.

15
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,050
You see does automate automated you read compiles.

16
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,830
And of course this also means that if we would do anything which is not allowed.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,830
Like for example reassigning to a constant and then a wrong type as well.

18
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,910
Whenever we tried to do that of course it all recompensed.

19
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,250
But then just as if we manually run the command we see the compilation error down there.

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,560
So watch mode is already a big improvement.

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,670
The downside is that we still have to specifically target this file here and at the moment of course

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,980
this is the only file we're working with.

23
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,820
But typically in bigger projects that's not necessarily the case.
