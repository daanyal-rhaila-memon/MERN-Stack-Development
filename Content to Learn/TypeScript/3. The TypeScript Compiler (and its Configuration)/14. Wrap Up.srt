1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,170
And that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,210
We had a very detailed look at the types of compiler how you can configure it and how you can make sure

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,840
that it really compiles your code the way you want.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,660
We had to look at all these different options especially district options really allow you to write

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,960
correct code and not run into strange bugs strange or runtime bugs you might face for example with the

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,460
strict null checks.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,250
And in addition to that we had a look at debugging how you can easily configure chrome and view as code

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,740
such that you can debug from inside view as code debugging from inside chrome with source maps and the

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,420
sources tab of course is always an option.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,740
The key here also are the source maps which you are configuring to be generated in the tiers config

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,200
file which are these map files that live next to your JavaScript files.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,840
They basically act as bridges for the debugger between your JavaScript files and your Tapscott files.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,720
And with that we know a bit more regarding how to manage our projects.

14
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,030
Let's now see what else we can do with TypeScript and JavaScript.
