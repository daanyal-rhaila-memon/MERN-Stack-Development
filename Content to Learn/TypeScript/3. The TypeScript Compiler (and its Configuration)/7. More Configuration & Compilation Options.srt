1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,380
Now also interesting is allow J.S. with allow J.S. and by the way all the way Czech chess.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,610
You can also include JavaScript files in the compilation.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,030
Now with allow J.S. a jobs good file will be compiled by typescript so even if it doesn't end with thought

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,880
yes types could will compile it with check.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,970
J.S. It will not compile it but it will still check the syntax in there and report potential errors.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,140
This could be nice if you don't really want to use typescript but you want to take advantage of some

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,330
of its features.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,690
And as far as typescript can help you with any type only which is effectively what you have in JavaScript

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,560
it will do so if you enabled these options.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,480
Now we don't need it for this project and for this project we would want to make sure we don't double

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,000
compile these JavaScript files which do stem from types of files so we would have to tweak to include

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,710
and exclude settings a bit but you could use that in projects where you don't want to use typescript

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,430
at all.

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,750
Or where for whatever reason you have some vanilla javascript files next to your types good files and

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,550
you want to check the vanilla javascript files as well.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,170
Now let's fast forward a bit.

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,630
J as X is an option that can help you with react J.S. which does not really matter for us here.

18
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,330
Declaration and declaration map is all is not important.

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,840
Your DTA s files are an advanced concept which matter to you if you are shipping your project as a library

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,020
to our people and you need it basically a manifest file which describes all the types you have in your

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,730
project.

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,050
That's such a detail as file source map is an interesting one.

23
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,270
Though.
