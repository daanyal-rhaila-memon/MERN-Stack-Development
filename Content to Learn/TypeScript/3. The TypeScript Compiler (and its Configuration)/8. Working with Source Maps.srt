00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,000
Source map helps us with debugging and development so to show what this does.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,510
Let me compile everything without that's where it's map setting.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,950
If we now go to the browser and we want to understand what our code does we can go to the sources tab

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,660
here indie developer tools and there we find our JavaScript files.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,780
Now we can dive into these files and the good thing is these files are fairly readable to us humans

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,980
of course because they contain javascript code in the end.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,740
Now that's good.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:40,050
But what if we had more complex types of code and we want to debug our typescript code and not the compiled

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,350
javascript code.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,620
In other words it would be nice if we would see the types of files here and not the JavaScript files

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,610
with the source map option you can get there.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,340
If you set this to true and you run the TSC command again then you see we got these dot J.S. dot map

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,840
files being generated as well.

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,920
Now if we look at them they're pretty strange files but what they do is they basically act as a bridge

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:12,120
which is understood by modern browsers and developer tools there to connect the JavaScript files to

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,440
the input files.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,940
So with these files generated if I reload here you see in the sources tab we now not just have our JavaScript

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,630
files.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,420
We also see our types could files there and we can even place breakpoints in the type of files.

20
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,180
And if I now click on that button for example it pauses in the typescript file which is of course super

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,750
super convenient because dad really takes our debugging process to the next level because we can work

22
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,600
directly in our input files.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,940
Basically in our types could files instead of the JavaScript files now.

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,820
Nonetheless here I'll comment this out because we have a fairly simple project here and I don't want

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,580
to have these extra dot map files lie around here.

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,780
But this is super useful in projects because it simplifies debugging.
