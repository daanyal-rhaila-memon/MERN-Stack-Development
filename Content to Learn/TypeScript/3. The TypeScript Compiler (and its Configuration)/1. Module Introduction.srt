00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,890
In this module we'll take a closer look at the typescript compiler.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:13,170
Thus far we always just used it by running TSC and then pointing at a file which we want to compile.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,490
Now whilst that of course works it's not really feasible for bigger projects where you have multiple

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,540
files or where you simply don't want to run this command.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,020
After every change you want to see in practice in addition to that convenience which we currently don't

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,750
have.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,560
There also are a couple of interesting things you can configure regarding the compilation process which

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,320
actually change what is compiled and how it is compiled.

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,970
And these are therefore the things we'll take a closer look at in this module.
