1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,100
So as I mentioned in the last lecture watch mode is a great start.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,130
But what if we have more than one typescript file.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:18,550
What if we all have analytics start T.S. file where we hypothetically send analytics data to our server.

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:24,280
Now here to just have anything in there I'll just put in the console log statement.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,180
But of course you could be sending H to the p requests to your analytics service here as I said.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:36,360
So let's say we also did import this file here in our engaged him file.

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:44,110
If we point at analytics dot J as here which does not exist yet but which will exist after compilation

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,570
then we could be loading these two files and of course we want to compile both files whenever one of

9
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,860
them changes.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,670
Now for that it would be nice if we could enter some general watch mode where we just run TSC like this.

11
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:04,270
So without pointing out a file and it just watches our entire project folder and recompile as any types

12
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:11,250
could follow that might change well turns out that this is possible for Dad we just need to tell typescript

13
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:19,030
that this year is one project dad should be managed with TypeScript and we do that by first of all.

14
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,770
And we only need to do this once running TSC dash dash in it.

15
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,190
So I'm not pointing at a specific file here.

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,420
I just run TSC and then dash dash in it here and again this is only required ONCE IT will initialize

17
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,430
this project in which you run this command as a typescript project.

18
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:43,120
That means it will now basically tell typescript that everything in the folder where you run this command

19
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,830
and therefore it's important that you navigate it into the right folder before you ran this command

20
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,710
with the built in terminal here in V as code I'm automatically in this project folder where my files

21
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,220
are.

22
00:01:54,370 --> 00:02:00,870
So that this project is now managed by Hapgood lets it enter and what this does is it creates this as

23
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,900
conflict adjacent file.

24
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:11,350
This basically is the indicator for typescript bad the project in which this file lies and all sub folders

25
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,730
of this folder should be managed by typescript.

26
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,860
Now if we have a look into this file we see there are a bunch of options.

27
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,470
Most of them are common that out there just errors so that you see that you could set them and you've

28
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,280
got a short explanation here as well but we don't have to worry about those right now we'll dive into

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,080
them in a second.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,150
For the moment let's just close this file here and let's see what this gives us because what it does

31
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:43,200
give us is that we can now run just TSC like this without pointing at a specific file and what this

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,790
will do is it will tell typescript to go ahead and compile all typescript files so all dot t is files

33
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,530
it can find in this project if I hit enter year you see this takes a while and now what we got is this

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,650
analytics Dutch js file and does app J.S. file.

35
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,060
Now the analytics jazz file was just created by typescript because it found that we have the analytics

36
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,510
of T file and as I said it will now compile all types of files in the project.

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,600
And of course this can all be combined with watch mode.

38
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:25,200
You can run TSC dash w or dash dash watch as I showed before and this will now enter watch mode for

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,970
all types good files.

40
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,750
So now whenever I change one of them and I save it it will recompile and it will recompile that file

41
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,000
that changed and therefore all the reflect the change in the javascript file and hence.

42
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,140
Now here if I go back to my page we see sending data here as well because now the analytics t as file

43
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,340
was also compiled.
