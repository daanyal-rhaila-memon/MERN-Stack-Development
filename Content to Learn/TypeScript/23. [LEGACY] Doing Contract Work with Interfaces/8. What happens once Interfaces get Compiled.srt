1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,820
So we really learned a lot about interfaces and with that, you have all the core tools you will need to work

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,260
with them and to use them in production and your applications. Now there is

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,790
one interesting thing I want to show you with all that code

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,830
but if we have a look at the app.js file, there is something interesting you will see.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,700
We see the function changeName, we see the person, we see all our function calls here of course and

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,730
this file is much shorter than the app.ts file

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,460
and that's not just because of the empty lines I have in here.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,660
Where is this interface code,

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,210
how does this get compiled to Javascript?

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,120
Yes, here is the greet function,

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,220
so it should be before the greet function but this file starts with the greet function.

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,980
Well the very simple answer is interfaces get not compiled at all,

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,160
they're just there to check your code

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,200
during compilation to give you compilation errors.

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,580
Javascript doesn't know explicit types, it doesn't know interfaces therefore,

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:18,640
so interfaces get totally ignored when transforming your code to Javascript. In this Javascript code,

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,660
you see no trace of any interface and they're only there to give you errors

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:32,770
if you make an error at development time when working with TypeScript before or during compiling

19
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,980
it. That's the time when you will get errors and when interfaces matter, thereafter they're just left

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,450
out.
