00:00:02,160  -->  00:00:08,460
Well so far we only considered properties here on our interface but that's not all we can do,

2

00:00:08,460  -->  00:00:17,630
we could also add a method. So let's say our NamedPerson should be able to also greet itself,

3

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:25,120
so we might have a greet method on our person. Now setting up a method is actually pretty easy too. We

4

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:33,300
just write it like we write method in a class, like so, greet, then we might have any inputs we want,

5

00:00:33,300  -->  00:00:39,840
in this case this might be none but if we need let's say something or let's say we have the lastName

6

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:45,590
as a input which would be a string and then we specify what should be returned by this function.

7

00:00:45,600  -->  00:00:47,560
So void if we here want to

8

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:51,890
console log in the method or whatever type you need.

9

00:00:52,320  -->  00:00:59,380
Well with this, we get errors here because our person is not really implementing this greet method.

10

00:00:59,790  -->  00:01:05,520
So actually I can set this NamedPerson type here already so that we're getting the errors

11

00:01:05,520  -->  00:01:06,430
here too

12

00:01:06,900  -->  00:01:13,240
and I can fix it by adding the greet method to it, like so.

13

00:01:13,370  -->  00:01:25,550
Now here of course, I need to get lastName as the input and then I can simply log I am and then

14

00:01:25,640  -->  00:01:36,660
just log this .firstName plus and then an empty space, lastName like so.

15

00:01:36,660  -->  00:01:39,570
Now what that allows me to do of course is here,

16

00:01:39,570  -->  00:01:45,380
this will not work anymore because here I don't have that method, so I will just comment it

17

00:01:45,390  -->  00:01:45,970
out

18

00:01:46,410  -->  00:01:57,350
but here I can then call person.greet and enter any lastName, then compile my code

19

00:01:57,830  -->  00:02:01,880
and if we have a look at our console, well then we see

20

00:02:01,890  -->  00:02:02,760
Hello Anna,

21

00:02:02,810  -->  00:02:09,170
Hi I'm Anna anything because I'm changing the first name here with changeName and then I'm calling

22

00:02:09,170  -->  00:02:10,780
greet anything.

23

00:02:10,790  -->  00:02:18,900
So that's how you set up the requirement that your object here also has this greet method.
