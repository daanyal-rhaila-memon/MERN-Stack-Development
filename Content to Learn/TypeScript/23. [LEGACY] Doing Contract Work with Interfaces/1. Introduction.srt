00:00:01,780  -->  00:00:08,040
Until now, we already learned a lot about TypeScript, we learned about a lot of the core features.

2

00:00:08,050  -->  00:00:15,730
Now it's time to also come to some features which are brand new, brand new introduced by TypeScript, something

3

00:00:15,760  -->  00:00:22,610
we didn't really know before from the Javascript world because modules, classes and so on,

4

00:00:22,660  -->  00:00:28,600
these are all things we already knew from Javascript even though we might have had some different approaches

5

00:00:28,600  -->  00:00:29,540
of getting there

6

00:00:29,620  -->  00:00:31,990
but it's not brand new. Now

7

00:00:32,020  -->  00:00:40,180
this module looks at interfaces which really is a concept you didn't know before in Javascript.

8

00:00:40,180  -->  00:00:42,480
Now I'm not going to spoil the fun,

9

00:00:42,490  -->  00:00:45,600
what are interfaces and why would we use them?

10

00:00:45,730  -->  00:00:48,250
Let's have a look at that in the next lectures.
