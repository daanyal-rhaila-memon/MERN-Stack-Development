1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,910
This course is packed with content.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,420
We're almost done getting started and they're off there will dive right into TypeScript and into all

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,870
its exciting features to learn them step by step.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,850
We'll start with the typescript basics of course the core types how it generally works.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,760
Some of the new features it adds and all you need to know to get a good understanding of typescript

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,390
they're after will already dive deeper into the types of compiler and the configuration of it because

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,580
it's super important for you to understand what you can configure there and what all these different

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,490
settings do.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,840
So we'll have a closer look at that in this module.

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:46,810
Thereafter We'll explore next generation javascript features supported in typescript how they work and

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,940
how you can use them in typescript.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:55,760
We'll continue with classes and interfaces a super important concept partly also in vanilla javascript.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,600
In the case of classes but with interfaces we also got a brand new typescript feature and you will understand

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,200
what they are what they do and why we might want to use them.

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,200
After it's time to dive deeper.

16
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,210
We'll have a look at some advanced types and advanced types good features in general.

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,790
Taking it to the next level there and building up on the basics we already learned about up to this

18
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,110
point.

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:27,250
Also an advanced feature which definitely deserves its own section is d generics feature.

20
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,140
You will learn what that is and why it's really really helpful.

21
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:39,250
In this module followed by decorators decorators are a pretty cool feature also added by TypeScript

22
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,880
and we'll have a closer look at decorators and all the builds I'm really useful decorators in that module

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,660
and thereafter we will have learned a lot about typescript now the course is organized such that I show

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,030
all these individual features in relatively small simple demos.

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,980
Now to also give you a bigger picture and to see how you would apply all these features in a real project

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,170
will build just that we'll have a whole module where we built an entire project entirely with typescript

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,740
from scratch so that you see many of these features.

28
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,590
Most of these features you'll learn about up to that point in action and you'll see how they work together

29
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,180
and why they simplify the process of building such a project.

30
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,640
Once we're done building this project will identify a new problem and we'll learn how to solve it by

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:40,550
working with namespace and modules which will help us make our code more manageable and readable.

32
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:47,080
Building up on that will also explore Westpac with typescript Westpac is a build tool we use in modern

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,620
front end web development and you can use it combined with typescript to get a better project setup

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,010
which simply makes certain things easier and allows you to get the best of both worlds.

35
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,120
A great development experience and also code that works really well for your end users.

36
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,220
Once we're done with that we have a very solid picture of TypeScript and how to work with it in projects.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,660
Now what you will need in a lot of real projects are third party libraries so we will take a closer

38
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,690
look at that because there are certain third party libraries which really embrace TypeScript and have

39
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,540
built in typescript support but there also are many libraries which don't and we'll have a look at how

40
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,410
we can work with both types of libraries in a great way.

41
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,180
Entire good projects.

42
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,650
Well and then there are some specific scenarios which does serve their own modules.

43
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:46,030
We'll have a whole module about react with typescript how you can build an entire react application

44
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:53,320
with typescript only and also an entire module about node J.S. and express and typescript.

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,490
So did you also have great examples for these very popular and specific use cases of typescript where

46
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,700
you can suddenly create react or node applications in a brand new way with a brand new language.

47
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,280
So lots of exciting content in the course.

48
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,970
Let's not waste any time.

49
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,110
Let's see how you can get the most out of the course and thereafter.

50
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,150
Let's dive in.
