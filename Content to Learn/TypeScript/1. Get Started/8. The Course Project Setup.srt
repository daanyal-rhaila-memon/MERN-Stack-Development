1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,910
So we set up D I.D. which is important.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,340
Now let's also set up a starting project which will use for all at this course in the different course

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,300
modules.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,770
So basically a project setup with which we can start every course module to then write our code there.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,920
Now as you will see for all this cause writing code doesn't require a complex set up in general but

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,730
here I want to project where we can write code compile it and then immediately see the output of that

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,520
code in the browser.

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:39,490
And for that I'll first of all add a new index H TO MAIL file and you can add this in any empty folder.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,910
The two other files or folders you see here are just config files for GID in case you're using version

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,490
control.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,590
And for my editor which sets the same level so that's all I have here.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,370
But in that index H html file I will now initialize it with a base skeleton and for data in visual pseudocode

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,760
you can just type h him l choose that H HTML5 option.

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,620
If you're not getting this menu just press the control in space choose the H HTML5 option and hit enter

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,710
and you'll get this skeleton there we could enter understanding typescript here as a title but that

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,160
does not matter to much more important.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:26,960
Instead here you add a script tag in your head section and add a source and point at app J.S. here and

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,930
add the deferred attribute.

19
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:35,540
This tries to import an app as file which of course right now doesn't exist and it will then of course

20
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,030
also execute it if it finds it.

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:45,470
This allows us to view our changes our code changes directly on the screen in the browser or if we're

22
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,580
just logging something to the console in the browser dev tools.

23
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,520
Next I will add an app dot key as file that's the file a typescript file where we will write some code

24
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:01,600
and there for example you could console log your code goes here or whatever you want.

25
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:07,750
You can console log whatever you want here and if you do that you can compiled this file with typescript

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,730
which we installed earlier for Dad you can open the terminal integrated into the editor here and simply

27
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,530
write TSC app dot t.

28
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,010
This compiles this types could file and generates the app J.S. file now which is to file we're importing

29
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,760
here.

30
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,670
And if you now open this index H.M. file you'll see whatever happens in here you kick off the logic

31
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:34,630
you wrote in here and even that's logic that manipulate something on the dom or like in this case it's

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,880
logic which simply gets locked to the console.

33
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,720
So here in this case I opened does H smell file in the browser.

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,490
You can simply double click on it outside of the idea.

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,150
So in the normal windows explorer or the Mac finder and then maybe open your developer tools if you're

36
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,010
just logging something to the console and you'll see your log here.

37
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,800
Now that's nice but whenever we change something here in our code we have to manually recompile.

38
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,390
Well that is what it is for now.

39
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:09,200
It will change later in of course but we also have to manually reload this page here and to speed this

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,440
up and make sure that you don't have to do this whenever you change something will actually also add

41
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,470
another tool here to this dummy setup which we'll use for this course.

42
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,120
So that this happens automatically.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,840
Now to install such a tool let's run NPM in it here in this project folder.

44
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:35,080
The NPM command is a way lable if you installed node J.S. make sure that for Dad you visit notorious

45
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,940
thought ORIC and download and install the latest version you find here for the moment we're not going

46
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,210
to write any note J.S. code but no chance comes to gather with the NPM tool which you can use to install

47
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:53,240
third party dependencies or useful tools that speed up our development and for that reason we need it

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,510
here.

49
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,990
So with that installed you can run NPM in it.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,460
In this project folder simply at enter and you can answer all these questions here with the defaults

51
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,500
by simply hitting enter all the time and once this completes it gives you a package stuck Jason File

52
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:13,400
which looks something like this and now you can run npm install to install dependency which is exclusive

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,450
to this project.

54
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:20,780
So to install a tool you could say which you can use in this project dash dash safe dash death to market

55
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,560
as a development only dependency.

56
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,010
So a tool that helps us during development and does not contain any code which will execute as part

57
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,530
of our main code and the tool name is light dash server.

58
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:41,230
If you hit enter here does installs this extra tool and once this finishes just go into your package

59
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:47,510
stop Jason File and in the scripts part add a comma and add a new script which you named start and then

60
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,540
as a value between double quotes enter a light dash server so that name of the package which was added

61
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:00,950
here if you now hit Enter you can run NPM start here to start this start script and light server is

62
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,980
a simple development server which always serves the index H to mail file next to the package not Jason

63
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,340
fault.

64
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:15,110
So this file and it serves your application on this you are L you see your local host three thousand

65
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:22,400
by default and you can then just visit dislocation simply enter local host colon three thousand in the

66
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,390
browser.

67
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,880
And now your code runs here.

68
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,210
And why is this better.

69
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,700
Well this will not automatically reload the page whenever another file in this directory changes.

70
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,970
So if I for example add exclamation mark here and I save this and I then compiled is again with TSC

71
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:46,600
app dot t T.S. and you go back to the browser you'll see the latest output immediately because it automatically

72
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,630
reloaded and that simply saves us the extra work of reloading manually.

73
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,580
Not important about this NPM start process.

74
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,190
Definitely keep it running as long as you are working on your project as long as you are writing code

75
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,830
which you want to see execute in the browser.

76
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,350
Once you're done you can always quit this process with control C but once you do so your project is

77
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,610
no longer getting served under local host three thousands.

78
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,640
So keep it up and running as long as you are writing code and making changes.

79
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,520
With that I'll change it back.

80
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,840
But this is totally up to you.

81
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,850
And this is the project setup.

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,750
I will use fraud.

83
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,440
This course you'll also find it attached of course in the finished form.

84
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,200
Just one important note.

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:33,820
If you download the attached starting Project or any average course snapshot any other code snapshot

86
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,920
you'll find anywhere in the course.

87
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,080
Then you will get a download that does not include does note modules folder.

88
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,040
This is a huge folder which in the end stores all third party packages and their dependencies.

89
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,100
And since it is so huge I typically delete it because you can easily recreate it by running npm install.

90
00:06:54,130 --> 00:07:00,880
So if you download one of my attachments navigate into the extracted folder and in that folder run npm

91
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,810
install and this will install all dependencies and recreate does node modules folder and once you did

92
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,970
this you can run NPM start or do whatever you want to do in this project and was dead.

93
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,790
We got this project set up we'll use for the course.

94
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,160
Now let's not waste any more time and let's just get started.
