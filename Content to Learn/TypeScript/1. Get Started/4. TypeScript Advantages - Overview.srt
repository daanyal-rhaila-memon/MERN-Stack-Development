1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,790
So you saw typescript in action and it offers great advantages.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:14,980
It makes writing clean code really easier typescript adds types and Data's super important with types.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:22,090
We have to be way more explicit about how things work and we can avoid many unexpected and unnecessary

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,520
errors by using types.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,510
In addition to that we also can use I.D. modern I.D. which have built in types of support which can

6
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:38,350
pick up on these types and give us better auto completion and built in errors which show before we even

7
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,870
compiled a code because they all understand typescript.

8
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,660
But besides the types and the huge advantages we get a loan by using types we also get our features

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:56,610
added by typescript we can use certain next generation javascript features which you can write and use

10
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,340
in our typescript files and then they will get compiled down to JavaScript code to work arounds that

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,550
even work in older browsers.

12
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,170
If you know Babel which is a tool that allows us to do that with vanilla javascript as well.

13
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,710
It's a bit like debt just already built into typescript we can use modern javascript features and still

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,290
produce and ship code that works in older browsers as well.

15
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:29,070
Types could also add certain features which only types could understand like interfaces and generics.

16
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:35,140
These are features which can't be compiled to javascript but they don't have to because they are features

17
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,690
that help us during development that give us clearer errors and help us a wide.

18
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,000
Even more errors.

19
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,950
So it even adds more features on that front.

20
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:51,970
Besides the types we already learn about it also gives us certain meta programming features like decorators

21
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,760
on which I have a whole module in this coords where you will understand what exactly decorators are

22
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:04,260
why they are so meta and why they are amazing typescript could all is highly configurable.

23
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,300
We didn't configure it thus far but I have a whole module in the course where we talk only about the

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,990
compiler and how to configure it and you can really fine tune it to your requirements to make it stricter

25
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:25,150
or looser and to ensure that it behaves in exactly the way you wanted to behave and with modern tooling

26
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,530
with modern I.D. you even get support in non types good projects.

27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,970
The idea you just saw visuals through you code that even gives you better support in plain JavaScript

28
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:44,730
files because it is able to use some types of features under the hood without you explicitly using typescript.

29
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:51,980
So that's a free gain you get out of the box when being aware of TypeScript and when using modern tools.

30
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,880
So there are many reasons for using TypeScript and that's probably why you took this course in this

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,520
course we will now learn it step by step and we will learn all about the amazing features it adds.
