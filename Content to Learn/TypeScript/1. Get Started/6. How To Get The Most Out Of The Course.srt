1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:07,630
Your success matters to me and I want to ensure that you get the most out of this course.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,690
No of course that starts with watching the videos.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,120
This is a video on the mind course self.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,610
Course watch the videos.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,350
You can go through this course step by step.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,940
It's built in such a way that all the modules and lectures built up on each other.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,030
You can also skip cert modules of course because all the modules all do work on their own.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,990
If you already know a concept for example now when watching the videos of course do that at your speed.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,150
You got speed controls here in the video player and you can slow me down if I'm going too fast or speed

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,410
me up if I'm going to slow for your taste.

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,440
I also recommend that you code along.

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:52,090
It's not a must do but you typically learn better if you write code on your own and you have to find

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:58,480
and fix your own mistakes all the pause and rewind the videos for that because the videos are of course

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,170
recorded in a way that also makes sense to people who are not coding along.

15
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:09,580
So if you do you might need to pause occasionally try out the next steps on your own or go back to an

16
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:16,060
earlier point in a video to see how exactly I implemented something there and in general practicing

17
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:23,410
is important in this course we work on real projects and we have many smaller demos and I can only encourage

18
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:29,710
you that you sometimes pause and try out the next steps on your own or that you deviate from what I

19
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,750
do and try out your own things.

20
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,140
So definitely all the advance on your own.

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,920
Of course only to a certain extent because if you haven't learned about a certain feature it might be

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,620
hard to implement it on your own but whenever possible whenever you feel like it.

23
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,570
Definitely try out things on your own.

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,400
Now when you do that or when you just code along as well you will also face some errors.

25
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,370
Things don't always go as planned.

26
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,170
You introduced a mistake in your code and you get an error.

27
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:05,290
Now debug these errors and search on your own you will see attached code which you'll find attached

28
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,990
to many lectures in the course always to the last lecture of each module so that you can compare your

29
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:17,440
code to mine and find out where it deviates but also if you get error messages google them or use the

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,020
search here and you'll need me to also search the Q and A section because chances are someone else had

31
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,780
a similar error and you can quickly fix it by looking at their solution.

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,970
Now of course if you're really stuck or if some concept is unclear you can also ask but also answer

33
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,280
here in the Q and A section.

34
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,090
I do my best to provide quick support there but also try to help others there on your own because besides

35
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:50,170
fixing your own errors if you all will help others and work with our students you get a lot out of this

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,400
course as well so that's definitely all the recommendation I have.

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,390
And with all these steps or all these building blocks you have everything you need to get the most out

38
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,210
of this course.

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,830
In the next lecture I will show you d d setup the idea e I will be using for this course and thereafter

40
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,870
we can already dive into typescript.
