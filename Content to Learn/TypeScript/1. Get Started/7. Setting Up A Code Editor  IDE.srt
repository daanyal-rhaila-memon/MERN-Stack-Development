1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,320
Typescript is amazing but an order to work with it efficiently.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,900
I strongly recommend that you also have a powerful code editor a powerful idea.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,690
And here my clear recommendation is Visual Studio code.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,040
It's free to use and it has amazing typescript support built in.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,650
Now you still need to install the types of compiler and we already did this but this has to be built

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,430
in support.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,570
Which shows you a lot of errors directly Endy i.e. before you even compiled the project so you can simply

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,420
visit code or visuals to do dot com and there you can download it for any operating system and simply

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,810
walk through the installer there to get this modern idea.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,550
Now it is the idea I will be using for all this course.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,550
And you can find tune and configure it to your requirements and needs.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,950
Here are just some settings I'm using under a code references.

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,760
You can change the color theme and there I am using the dark plus theme.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,780
So if you want the exact same look that's the theme I'm using.

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,410
But of course you can also play around with any arrow theme here.

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,020
I also installed certain extensions so third party plugins so to say which changed the appearance or

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,080
behavior of the editor.

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,110
You can click on View and then extensions to be taken to the extensions menu or the marketplace and

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,030
it's all free.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,600
No worries nothing here cost you money.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,690
Now I got tons of extensions installed but the extensions I would recommend that you definitely have

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,980
a look at is E as lint that you installed this to get a listing to get code quality check support in

23
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,170
your projects and that you installing material.

24
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,590
I can theme if you like these file icons I have in my projects.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,710
That's a pure visual thing of course.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,660
It doesn't change any behaviors and it can all recommend path intelligence so that later in the course

27
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:02,190
once we work with imports you get better support their and prettier which helps you format your code

28
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,310
so that it always looks nice and is readable prettier works together with a certain shortcut which you

29
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,310
should be aware of under Preferences Keyboard shortcuts there.

30
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,560
If you search for format document this shortcut here is a shortcut you can always press in your code

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,550
to auto format it to add missing semicolons to make sure you use the right indentation everywhere things

32
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,190
like that it makes your code more readable and your life as a developer easier and that's it.

33
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,250
You can also install t as lint but that will be merged with E as lint in the future so EA's land should

34
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,050
be all you really need.

35
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,550
With that we can go back to view explorer and you should have the same settings.

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:52,140
I have here but all the dive into the settings in general and explore them and find to everything to

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,930
your needs and to your likings.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,150
And with that you have a great editor which allows you to write great code powerful code with a lot

39
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,500
of build and type support and you're well-prepared to get the most out of this course.
