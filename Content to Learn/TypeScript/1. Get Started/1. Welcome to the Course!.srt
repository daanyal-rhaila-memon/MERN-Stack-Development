Hi and welcome to this course.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,060
My name is Maxim Schwartz Mila and I will be your instructor in this course.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:16,390
Now this course is about typescript superset 2 javascript so a programming language which actually builds

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,010
up on javascript.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,690
You could say it takes javascript to the next level with typescript.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:28,660
You will see in this course you can write less error prone much better and cleaner code and also use

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,950
some exciting new features which don't exist like this in javascript.

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,910
Now in this course you will learn typescript from scratch.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,450
You don't need to know anything about typescript to get started.

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,880
Basic javascript knowledge absolutely suffices.

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:49,600
You will learn all the basics of typescript how it works why we use it the different advantages it offers

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,960
we'll dive into the core types it provides and we'll gradually build up knowledge and dive into more

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,910
and more advanced typescript features for all at this course.

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:06,490
Now this course is both a course that focuses on the theory and showing a broad variety of features

15
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,560
as well as showing all these features and action in real projects.

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,450
Therefore in this course we'll have a real project.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,710
We'll also have a module where we dive into typescript with react.

18
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,060
We'll also have a module where we dive into typescript with node and express so that by the end of this

19
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,550
course.

20
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:31,960
You really feel comfortable using typescript in your next projects and then you know why you would use

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,070
it.

22
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,690
And most importantly how you would apply it to any javascript project you're working on.

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,650
No matter.

24
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:44,850
By the way if data is JavaScript in the browser with or without any framework or if it's on the service

25
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,440
side.

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,320
So that's all in the course.

27
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,690
I'm super excited to start this journey together with you and with that I'd say let's not waste any

28
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,610
time and let's find out what exactly types code is and which advantages it has to offer.
