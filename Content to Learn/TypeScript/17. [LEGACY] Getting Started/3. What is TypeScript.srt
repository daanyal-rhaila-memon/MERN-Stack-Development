1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,880
So let's start with the most important question first, what is TypeScript? Before then in the next video, I'll

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,710
have a look at why and how.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,850
So what is TypeScript?

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,930
Well you know Javascript, Javascript is the script language you're using in the browser to make your web

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,740
sites reactive to run any code in the browser.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,490
Now Javascript is a great language and it's continuously getting extended,

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:35,940
it offers us a lot of features like constructor functions or prototypes and it uses dynamic types.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,480
Now I'm highlighting this types thing, that in Javascript a variable may be a string and then may get

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,380
a value of a number without any issues because the types is something I'll come back to as we're talking

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,470
about TypeScript here and you might tell by the name that types play an important role there.

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,880
So this is Javascript as we know it,

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,860
specifically you could say this is ES5,

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,780
we also get ES6 which is the next version of Javascript to put it like that, which introduces new

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,690
features to Javascript, like for example the class keyword and so on.

15
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,960
But the problem for one is that ES6 is not yet supported by all browsers,

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,990
so we do have some issues here with using native ES6 and the other issue is while it does enhance

17
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,020
Javascript, it does introduce new features,

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,430
there are still a lot of things where you could say that could be better, that it's a bit better in other

19
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:39,490
languages and there are some features we might want to use in Javascript which aren't available, now this

20
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:46,610
is where TypeScript comes in. TypeScript is a wrapper so to say, it compiles down to Javascript in

21
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:54,040
the end and introduces new features which we can use in our code and which will then run in the browser

22
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:02,740
as the TypeScript compiler will make sure to find ways to compile all these great new features into ES5

23
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,040
code to then run in any browser.

24
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:12,480
Now some of these features are generics or interfaces and of course, you will learn about these features

25
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:20,240
throughout this course, they're also a lot of other features and the most important feature are types or the fact that

26
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:28,220
TypeScript is a strongly typed language, which means you have to be specific which type a variable

27
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,340
is, so that you can't have a string variable and then assign a number to it and get through with it

28
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,400
and this actually is a great improvement as you will see the next video. Before coming to that video,

29
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,680
I already mentioned one important fact,

30
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:50,710
Typescript is a wrapper around Javascript so to say. TypeScript does not run in the browser,

31
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,150
we need to compile it to Javascript to run there.

32
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:01,090
Now whilst you might ask, well how can we compile features which aren't available in Javascript to

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,810
Javascript,

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:08,110
well I got a module on TypeScript compiler which also has a look at this but for now, just be aware that

35
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,640
we have to compile all our TypeScript code to Javascript as this will run in the browser in the end. So

36
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,750
TypeScript is only an extra language we can use during development,

37
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,800
it's not what runs in the browser.
