00:00:01,800  -->  00:00:06,110
Welcome to this course in TypeScript, I'm so happy to have you onboard. Now

2

00:00:06,150  -->  00:00:11,180
no matter if you're onboard because you want to learn what this thing you are using in your Angular 2

3

00:00:11,370  -->  00:00:11,990
project

4

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:13,010
actually is

5

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:18,210
or if you're onboard because you want to dive deeper into TypeScript and actually use it in other projects

6

00:00:18,240  -->  00:00:19,480
besides Angular 2,

7

00:00:19,830  -->  00:00:21,700
this course is for you.

8

00:00:21,780  -->  00:00:27,540
We're going to start simple, learn what TypeScript is, why we might use it and how we use it, how we install

9

00:00:27,540  -->  00:00:30,310
it and how we set up a basic project with it.

10

00:00:30,360  -->  00:00:33,870
Throughout this course, you will then learn what types actually are,

11

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:38,070
it's the thing what gives TypeScript the name in the end but why are they useful,

12

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:39,360
how do they work?

13

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:46,410
Before we dive into the compiler, learn about some of the ES6 features TypeScript supports and then dive into

14

00:00:46,410  -->  00:00:53,090
classes, namespace and modules to modularize our application and use the many benefits TypeScript offers

15

00:00:53,120  -->  00:00:54,570
us there. Thereafter

16

00:00:54,930  -->  00:01:01,220
it's time to have a look at some more TypeScript specific features which you won't find in plain or

17

00:01:01,280  -->  00:01:02,850
vanilla Javascript,

18

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:09,630
I'm talking about interfaces, generics or decorators to really enhance your project and give you brand

19

00:01:09,630  -->  00:01:13,350
new opportunities in your project or code.

20

00:01:13,370  -->  00:01:20,160
We will also have a look at how to integrate TypeScript in your existing workflow, like your webpack

21

00:01:20,190  -->  00:01:25,130
or Gulp workflow or build a brand new workflow using TypeScript only.

22

00:01:25,260  -->  00:01:30,120
Now oftentimes, you will also use third-party libraries like JQuery which are written in Javascript and

23

00:01:30,130  -->  00:01:31,590
not in TypeScript.

24

00:01:31,650  -->  00:01:37,680
We will learn how to implement them in our TypeScript project and let the compiler, the TypeScript compiler

25

00:01:37,680  -->  00:01:43,740
know what the library is all about it, even get IDE support and to wrap this all up,

26

00:01:43,740  -->  00:01:48,010
we're going to have a look at how to use ReactJS together with TypeScript.

27

00:01:48,180  -->  00:01:56,250
Yes this is possible and it's awesome and it shows you that you really can use TypeScript in any project

28

00:01:56,250  -->  00:01:57,660
of your choice.

29

00:01:57,660  -->  00:02:04,620
Now there are a lot more things, exercises and well I really love this course and I'm happy to have

30

00:02:04,620  -->  00:02:05,010
you here,

31

00:02:05,010  -->  00:02:07,290
so enough of the talking, let's dive into it.
