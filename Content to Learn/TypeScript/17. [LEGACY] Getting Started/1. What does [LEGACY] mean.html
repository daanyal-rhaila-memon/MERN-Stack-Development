<p>I <strong>updated this entire course</strong> to incorporate student feedback, add new features, improve it in many ways and also in order to cover all the exciting features that were added to TypeScript over the past years.</p><p><strong>You can read my full "course update announcement"&nbsp;(with more information)&nbsp;here</strong>: XXX</p><p>The <strong>[LEGACY]</strong> sections reflect the <strong>OLD&nbsp;</strong>course content (i.e. before I&nbsp;updated the course). I&nbsp;will keep that content around for some time to allow all students to finish it first and smoothly transition to the new content.</p><p>If you want, of course. You can also ignore all the old (=&gt;&nbsp;[LEGACY]) sections and just focus on the new content (i.e. all sections without [LEGACY])..</p>
