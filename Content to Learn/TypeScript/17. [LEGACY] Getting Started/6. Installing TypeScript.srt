1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,670
So in the last video, we use the playground

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:11,750
and as I said in the last video, you may use this playground to follow along the examples in this course

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,240
or play around with the playground in any way you want to play around with it.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,580
There are only some parts of the course, for example where we use multiple files, where you will get issues

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,180
when using the playground since it doesn't support this, at least not at the point of time when I recorded

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,320
this video.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,400
But anyways, you probably not only want to use the playground for TypeScript development, you want to be

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,490
able to work with it on your local machine,

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,160
therefore we need to install TypeScript there

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,520
and that's actually really easy to do.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,270
Open up a command line on your computer, on Mac or Windows and then you need to have Node installed on

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:56,320
your machine or specifically Nodes Package Manager, npm to install TypeScript.

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,450
Now as a developer, you probably already do have this because you use npm in a lot of projects to manage

14
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,540
your dependencies

15
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,060
but if you don't, simply head over to node.org

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:15,310
and download the latest version here, 6.5 in my example, download it, run through the installer

17
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:22,520
and again we won't really use Node here but we need npm, it's package manager. So download it, install

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,180
it and you will have npm as well.

19
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:31,290
Now with that finished and again we only need it to manage all the dependencies or our packages,

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:40,290
we can now globally install TypeScript on our machine by running npm -g install typescript,

21
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,820
this will fetch the latest version and install it on your machine.

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,500
Now on Mac, you may need to throw a sudo in front of it,

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,480
the same is true for Linux.

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,590
Now if you do this and well then of course enter your password,

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,630
in my case here at least, it will download TypeScript and install it on your machine. At the point of

26
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,700
time when I record this video as you can see,

27
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,900
1.8.1 was the latest version of TypeScript

28
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,370
but of course that may be higher in your case.

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,950
Now with that, you've got TypeScript on your machine and what we can do next is use it.
