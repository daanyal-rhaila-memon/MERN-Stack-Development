00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,000
So with TypeScript installed, in order to use it, you may create an example project like this one here,

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,420
simply an index.html file and a script.ts file.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,140
Now ts is important, that's just the extension because it's TypeScript not Javascript, .ts is the file

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:24,640
extension then. So I open both in Sublime here or use any text editor of your choice of course, including

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,850
very basic ones like Notepad, so whatever you like and as you can see my index.html has really just a

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,540
basic HTML5 skeleton with doctype, head and so on,

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,270
no extra code

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,740
whatsoever

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,920
and the script.ts file is completely void.

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,430
So with that, let's head over to the playground and fetch the code we use there to stay with that example.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,970
Back in the script.ts file,

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,790
I'm going to paste it in because I can use it as it is there,

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,100
I got my index.html file where I'll add the button later on and in order to use this file there, I of

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,020
course need to import it. So I'm doing this at the end of the body section here by adding script tags

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:13,470
and now I'm not importing script.ts even though that's the only file we have right now

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,260
but instead I want to use script.js

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,080
because remember it's Javascript code which runs in the browser, not TypeScript.

18
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,960
It will get compiled to Javascript code and this .js file will get created by TypeScript.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,230
So I'll make this a relative import by adding ./ at the beginning here.

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,470
Now of course if I simply double-click index.html and view it in the browser,

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,770
you see nothing happening,

22
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,570
well that's going to change.

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,100
Let's get back to the command line and navigate into this TypeScript folder which has the script.ts file

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,320
and the index.html file.

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:56,760
Let's now finally compile our file by navigating into this folder which holds the script.ts file and

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,420
then run tsc which is a command available once we install TypeScript as we did before which runs the

27
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,800
TypeScript

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,500
compiler and then passing the file we want to compile,

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,290
in this case it's script.ts. With that command we're telling TypeScript,

30
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,350
please take this script.ts file and compile it to Javascript.

31
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,740
So once I hit enter,

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,250
well we're not seeing any errors,

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,590
we would see any compilation errors at this step in this console and once we did this,

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,910
you can see we now got the script.js file here as well which was created by the compiler and

35
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,990
which will hold our compiled Javascript code.

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,390
Now with that in place, if I now reload this page and click the button, you get the same effect as in the

37
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,960
playground

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,610
but now on our local machine.
