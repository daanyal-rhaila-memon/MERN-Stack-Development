00:00:02,100  -->  00:00:07,380
Now when working with namespaces, one important note I want to make this you can also have namespaces

2

00:00:07,400  -->  00:00:09,260
in namespaces.

3

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:15,930
So here in MyMath, I could also have another namespace called circle, since this is the circle related

4

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:16,850
math,

5

00:00:16,890  -->  00:00:20,340
then I put all my logic into this circle namespace,

6

00:00:20,360  -->  00:00:23,840
I of course also need to export that namespace now

7

00:00:24,250  -->  00:00:30,060
and with this set up, what I can do is I can go back to my app.ts file, that won't work anymore as my

8

00:00:30,060  -->  00:00:34,770
IDE correctly shows me and I would have to access circle on that.

9

00:00:34,770  -->  00:00:41,520
Now if I save this and compile again into one single file, clear the console and reload,

10

00:00:41,520  -->  00:00:43,010
you'll see it's working again

11

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:46,430
but now we got some nested namespace as if you would need that.

12

00:00:46,440  -->  00:00:52,800
But of course make sure to not overdo it because you want to keep it somehow manageable in the

13

00:00:52,800  -->  00:00:56,470
end and not have 10 levels of namespace nesting,

14

00:00:56,490  -->  00:00:59,570
at least I assume that's not what you're interested in.

15

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:08,070
If you then want to still access everything on MyMath in the app.ts file for example, one thing you

16

00:01:08,070  -->  00:01:16,170
could do is you could add a special keyword, the import keyword that is, like so

17

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:21,870
and we're not using the ES6 syntax for importing here but what you can do here is you can simply say

18

00:01:21,870  -->  00:01:26,560
CircleMath and set this equal to MyMath.Circle,

19

00:01:27,930  -->  00:01:29,430
like that

20

00:01:29,670  -->  00:01:34,520
and then you can simply say CircleMath on that,

21

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:38,870
compile everything here and it still works.

22

00:01:38,880  -->  00:01:45,990
So with that, you're just setting up an alias here where you use the nested namespace and assign it to

23

00:01:45,990  -->  00:01:47,040
one single

24

00:01:47,040  -->  00:01:50,580
alias in the end which you then can use.

25

00:01:50,580  -->  00:01:57,870
So that's just some advanced techniques on namespaces but that is in general how you use namespaces,

26

00:01:57,870  -->  00:02:04,740
very important to make sure to bundle them into one single file or import all the files here with

27

00:02:04,740  -->  00:02:14,400
script tags and also make sure to add the right order of imports here in your main file or manually add

28

00:02:14,430  -->  00:02:19,180
all the files with the tsc command here when compiling it

29

00:02:19,440  -->  00:02:23,790
but always make sure that you're not forgetting any necessary imports here.
