1

00:00:01,760  -->  00:00:09,230
And when we are at the disadvantage of namespaces. Now our little example here is quite manageable

2

00:00:09,230  -->  00:00:09,520
right,

3

00:00:09,530  -->  00:00:10,980
because here

4

00:00:11,150  -->  00:00:17,660
we only get a couple of namespaces or a couple of files which we import here and which we then

5

00:00:17,660  -->  00:00:18,390
use here

6

00:00:18,500  -->  00:00:23,060
but we already have to watch out that we're not forgetting anything and that we're keeping the right

7

00:00:23,120  -->  00:00:24,230
order.

8

00:00:24,230  -->  00:00:31,910
The problem is that our modules if we want to call it like that, that our files are not very declarative

9

00:00:31,910  -->  00:00:40,220
about what they need. Let's say our circleMath here would need another namespace, then we would need

10

00:00:40,250  -->  00:00:45,030
to add the import either here or in the app.ts too

11

00:00:45,230  -->  00:00:51,080
but since we can add it anywhere where we want as long as we make sure that everything gets bundled

12

00:00:51,080  -->  00:00:54,190
into one file, it can be kind of hard to

13

00:00:54,800  -->  00:00:59,400
clearly see which file has which dependencies

14

00:00:59,690  -->  00:01:04,350
and it's not really that manageable for bigger projects.

15

00:01:04,400  -->  00:01:12,260
It has some disadvantages compared to the ES6 modules which are very declarative about which file

16

00:01:12,260  -->  00:01:20,540
or which module has which dependency and which also makes sure that each module, each ES6 module has

17

00:01:20,540  -->  00:01:25,970
its own scope and doesn't pollute the global scope.

18

00:01:25,970  -->  00:01:34,490
So whilst namespaces here are a great tool for smaller applications, you probably want to fallback

19

00:01:34,490  -->  00:01:37,570
to ES6 modules or modules in general

20

00:01:37,610  -->  00:01:40,570
when working on medium-sized to large projects.

21

00:01:40,580  -->  00:01:42,770
So let's have a look at modules next.
