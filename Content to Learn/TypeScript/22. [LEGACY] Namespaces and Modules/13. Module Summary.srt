1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,040
You are now really prepared to write bigger TypeScript applications,

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:13,650
you now know how to use namespaces or modules and when to use what. You are prepared to set up your

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:21,030
project in a way that you split up your code over multiple files, as well as logical modules, each containing

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,910
their own code or piece of your application.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,590
You then also learned how to put it all back together and make it run in your browser or in your application.

6
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,850
Time to move on to the next module.
