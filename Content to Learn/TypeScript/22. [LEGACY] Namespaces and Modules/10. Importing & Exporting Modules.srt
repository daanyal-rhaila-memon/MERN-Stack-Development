1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,940
With that, we can of course also add our rectangle file. Here

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,910
I first have to add the export keyword so that we're actually exporting something in this file and then

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,020
I can import from this file as well,

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:22,850
so from and then math and then rectangle and then here of course, I want to import the calculateRectangle

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,740
function.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:30,980
Now I can comment out this console log statement here and actually calculate the rectangle of 20 and 50

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,280
let's say, save this, compile everything with the tsc command,

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,400
load our app and we see 1000 there at the bottom which of course is the result of this rectangle calculation.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,290
So with that, we got all the imports and exports set up

10
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:53,630
and now regarding the styles of imports and exports or how you can use these imports and exports, pretty

11
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,530
much all the things you can learn about ES6 imports apply.

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:06,590
So to give some hints, since my circle class here or circle file has two exports, PI and calculateCircumference,

13
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,710
I could also use this syntax with a star to import everything and then assign it an alias,

14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,620
so as circle for example

15
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:22,940
and then I can access it on circle.PI and circle.calculateCircumference.

16
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,670
So that would also work as you can see once I compile this, clear my console, reload the app,

17
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,200
it still works,

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,920
so that is one possible syntax. Since my rectangle file only exports one function,

19
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,280
it would make sense to make this the default export.

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,680
So by adding the default keyword, I'm telling TypeScript or the same is true for ES6 Javascript

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,630
then that this should be the default you import whenever you try to import this file.

22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,810
So here, I can then and I have to get rid of this syntax with the curly braces,

23
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,420
instead I can choose whatever name I want to use because this file only exports one thing anyways,

24
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,290
so it's uniquely identified,

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,820
the name I specify here doesn't matter,

26
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,080
so I can just name this calc and then use calc here

27
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,690
and this will still refer to my calculateRectangle function here,

28
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,310
I'm just assigning a different name in the app.ts file.

29
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:28,330
So if I then compile this and reload my application, we still see everything is working fine.

30
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:34,560
So that's just a different syntax and just an alternative to the syntaxes you saw before.
