00:00:01,850  -->  00:00:07,980
Welcome to this module. You might have had the case that you had a Javascript project which really grew

2

00:00:07,990  -->  00:00:09,430
quite big

3

00:00:09,720  -->  00:00:17,790
and in the past already, we used some loaders, module loaders to modularize our Javascript projects and

4

00:00:17,790  -->  00:00:20,380
split it up over multiple files.

5

00:00:20,430  -->  00:00:27,930
Now turns out that TypeScript really supports modular code and it has two concepts it offers you to

6

00:00:27,930  -->  00:00:31,820
manage your project and split it up into different files

7

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:38,310
but not only files but also logical modules, namespaces and modules,

8

00:00:38,340  -->  00:00:40,370
it's just called modules.

9

00:00:40,560  -->  00:00:47,910
So we will learn about both concepts in this section of the course as you went to use each and how they

10

00:00:47,910  -->  00:00:48,610
work,

11

00:00:48,780  -->  00:00:50,010
so let's dive into that.
