1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,510
So in this module, we had a look at how to use the class keyword or use classes in TypeScript, how to

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:15,270
use inheritance and how classes make your code really much cleaner, leaner and object usage easier.

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,320
This is a powerful feature of TypeScript

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:25,780
and don't mistake TypeScript classes with ES6 classes, TypeScript classes are really more powerful than

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,090
that.

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,430
Now with that being said, it's time to move onto the next module where we will learn how to split up

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,990
our code over multiple files and modularize our project,

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:45,620
something you really want to use especially when using classes but in any bigger project as well.

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,180
So let's have a look at this in the next module.
