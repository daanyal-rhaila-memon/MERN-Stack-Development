00:00:01,730  -->  00:00:03,980
In the example from the last video,

2

00:00:04,020  -->  00:00:10,820
notice that I use these shortcuts to create a property, a public property named name which I instantly

3

00:00:10,820  -->  00:00:12,980
initialized here in the constructor.

4

00:00:12,980  -->  00:00:22,060
So what I can do is of course, I can simply log right name since this is a public property available

5

00:00:22,310  -->  00:00:26,690
and right here refers to this single instance which was created.

6

00:00:26,690  -->  00:00:29,440
Now what I also can do is I can set

7

00:00:29,470  -->  00:00:29,990
right

8

00:00:29,990  -->  00:00:35,130
name equal to something else because it is a public property,

9

00:00:35,150  -->  00:00:37,570
therefore I can access it from outside

10

00:00:37,640  -->  00:00:42,350
and that not only means reading, like I do here but also setting it.

11

00:00:42,350  -->  00:00:49,990
Now what if I want to make sure that I only can set it in the constructor here but not at any other

12

00:00:50,000  -->  00:00:50,460
place,

13

00:00:50,480  -->  00:00:54,390
so not from outside? I want to make it readable though.

14

00:00:54,860  -->  00:00:57,410
Well there are two ways to achieve this,

15

00:00:57,470  -->  00:01:03,440
one would be using a getter. We already learned about getters before, here.

16

00:01:03,620  -->  00:01:06,870
If you don't specify a setter but only a getter,

17

00:01:06,890  -->  00:01:12,530
so if we would remove this part here, then we would make this property readonly.

18

00:01:12,920  -->  00:01:19,530
Well if that is our goal, we can take a shorter route and simply add readonly in front of it.

19

00:01:19,580  -->  00:01:26,150
Now my IDE doesn't recognize this but this is valid code as you see if I compile this. If I do compile it,

20

00:01:26,630  -->  00:01:30,660
I get an error that in line 112 which is here,

21

00:01:30,950  -->  00:01:35,170
I want to assign something to a readonly property.

22

00:01:35,180  -->  00:01:42,200
Now if you want to avoid nasty IDE errors like these, you can also simply take the long form of setting

23

00:01:42,200  -->  00:01:42,850
this up,

24

00:01:42,890  -->  00:01:50,950
so by adding it up, public name which is a string like this and then simply assigning this name equals

25

00:01:50,970  -->  00:01:51,970
name here

26

00:01:52,190  -->  00:01:54,300
and now if you add readonly here,

27

00:01:54,380  -->  00:01:57,150
well at least my IDE doesn't complain anymore

28

00:01:57,230  -->  00:01:59,930
but again, the first code also worked

29

00:01:59,990  -->  00:02:07,730
and as you can see we get the same error here that we can't assign a value in this line because we're

30

00:02:07,760  -->  00:02:09,710
having a readonly property.

31

00:02:09,710  -->  00:02:12,780
So that's another neat addition with TypeScript 2.0.
