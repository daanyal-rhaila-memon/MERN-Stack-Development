1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,350
Now what if I wanted to change the age of my

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,080
person here?

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,000
Notice that age is protected, which means it's available in child classes too.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,950
I wouldn't have access to type

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:27,310
but age is something I can access and I can access it with the this keyword and then set this equal to

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:38,140
31 for example. If I save this, we see that now my age is 31 because I can use age with the this keyword

7
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:47,150
as again all the content from here is also available on my Max class, though that is not true for the

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,950
type which is private, which means it doesn't get inherited,

9
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,510
it stays in the super, in the parent class.

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:04,770
So if I try to log this type here, you already see I get an error here

11
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:11,450
and I also get a compilation error here because type is private and only accessible within the class

12
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,610
person and not by any child classes.

13
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:22,970
So I get undefined here as an error because I don't have access to that, so definitely have to get

14
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:29,360
rid of that and here you see the difference between protected and private. I can access protected properties but

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,130
not private ones.

16
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,560
And of course, you can adjust this Max class to whatever you want,

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,700
you can add methods, properties, just always keep in mind you inherit everything from your base class

18
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:51,140
except for private name or methods and properties marked as private and then you can extend it by

19
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,100
writing your own logic or overwrite it if you happen to define a method called printAge

20
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,210
in this case here or a property called name as you saw earlier in this module.
