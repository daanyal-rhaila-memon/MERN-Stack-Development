00:00:02,120  -->  00:00:05,170
So now that we had a look at ES6 in the last video,

2

00:00:05,220  -->  00:00:12,090
there's one feature ES6 also introduces which makes working with objects a lot easier or cleaner,

3

00:00:12,280  -->  00:00:19,850
classes. Now TypeScript also offers classes and it turns out that TypeScript's classes are even more

4

00:00:19,850  -->  00:00:22,310
powerful than ES6 classes.

5

00:00:22,370  -->  00:00:28,830
So time to get back to school and take the classes class and learn more about classes in this module

6

00:00:28,840  -->  00:00:29,110
.
