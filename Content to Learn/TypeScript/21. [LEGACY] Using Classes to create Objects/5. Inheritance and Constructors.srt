00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,120
So as I just said, I could add a constructor to this Max class here too

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,400
and I could do this to make sure that I don't have to pass a name here because the name is set in

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,230
stone anyways but I still need to pass the user class and somehow, my IDE is already giving me errors even

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,220
though I haven't written anything yet.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:32,680
The reason is when extending a class, you always have to call super first which calls the constructor

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,620
of your parent class.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,870
I didn't have to do that before because I didn't have a constructor

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,980
and in such a case, the parent's constructor will always be called

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,250
but if I define my own constructor, I have to call the constructor in the class

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:55,700
I am extending and I do this with the super keyword, super refers to the parent class by the way.

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:03,880
So with that, I call this constructor and I pass Max as a name here too, which of course allows me to comment

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,350
out this hard 

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,600
overwriting here because I'm setting the name here anyway.

14
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:17,560
I still expect to get a username though, so I expect this input and I pass this to the super constructor.

15
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:25,180
I'm not adding the public keyword here because username already is set up as a property of the parent

16
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,940
class

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,890
and again, I do have access to all the properties of the parent class. So with that, I can get rid of this name

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,040
because now my constructor only expects one argument

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,870
and if I save this,

20
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:49,100
you still see my max object with the name Max, the username lowercase max and this age and this time, 

21
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm using my own constructor here, though I am calling the super constructor.
