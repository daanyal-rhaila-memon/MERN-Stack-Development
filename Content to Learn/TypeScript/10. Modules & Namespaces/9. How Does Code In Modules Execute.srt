1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,470
Now besides these different imports and exports and taxes which are good to know there is one other

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:17,230
thing which you have to understand and know in Project state we're not just exporting a class or an

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:23,200
interface as we're doing it in all the other faults but we're actually exporting a constant project

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,850
state.

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,690
Now the thing is we're importing this constant in multiple our files.

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,720
We're importing it in the project list.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,320
TSA file overalls importing it and the project input t file.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,520
So we import from the same file multiple times.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,570
The question is does this code in this file namely the creation of this constant here.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:52,240
Does this run once or twice or how often does it run once per import statement or once for the entire

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,280
app.

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:01:01,000
Well turns out it runs once when the file is imported for the first time by any other file.

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,340
If a number of file then imports that same file again it does not run again.

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,670
We can all to validate this by adding a console log statement here running we'll see this only will

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,030
get printed ones.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,290
Even though we're importing project status both here and the project list.

17
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,150
Yes file and then the project input yes file still.

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,180
This will only be printed to the console once you see it here running.

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,750
It will never be printed a second time no matter what we do.

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,380
So this only runs once.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,310
This is how it behaves and this is just something you have to know.

22
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,590
So you can plan your app appropriately.
