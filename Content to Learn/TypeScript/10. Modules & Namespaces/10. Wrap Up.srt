1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:09,740
And that's it for modules now using modules is a super useful and important feature because it allows

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,460
you to write more maintainable and manageable code.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,910
Having it all in one file is a mess and really not an option for anything but very tiny projects using

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:26,420
either namespace or EA's modules is stale for a way better alternative since it makes sure that every

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,890
file on its own is relatively small and therefore stays manageable.

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,740
And still you end up with debt and higher bake application.

7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,520
You want to have in the end.

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,430
Now when it comes to these two approaches name spaces and is modules the clear recommendation is is

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:50,810
modules because you get that extra type safety and you ensure that every file has to clearly specify

10
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,550
what it wants with name spaces.

11
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,360
It was enough if one file import that's something that a number of file also needs.

12
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,010
The downside is if that one file which imported the thing is removed that other file all the breaks

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,140
without you noticing at least without you noticing before you run the code.

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,760
So they offer you as EA's modules use namespace as in smaller projects or if for some reason you can't

15
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,930
use EA's modules and you can't use a number bundler which would translate such modules to non module

16
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:30,380
code which also works in older browsers but other than that really use modules is modules and what I

17
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,150
just said is important.

18
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,810
These modules here right now the way we used them only work in modern browsers because we rely on the

19
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,710
browser to basically import all these files.

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:48,680
Right now of course we want to build applications with typescript did all the run in older browsers

21
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,730
Internet Explorer 9 for example there.

22
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,750
This would not be supported this syntax is not supported there.

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,450
So the app would not run there.

24
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,670
We might also be using some other features that are not supported there but mainly this year is not

25
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,560
supported in all browsers.

26
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,280
So to make that work in all browsers we can use a bundling tool we can use Westpac for example to bundle

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,790
that together into one JavaScript file so that during development we have this multi file strong typing

28
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:23,000
experience but when we ship our code we actually have one file only and no advantage of shipping one

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,240
file instead of all these files we have here is that we also ensure that the browser doesn't have to

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,540
download that many files because every file that has to be downloaded is an extra hour round trip in

31
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,940
the Network tab of the daft words you can actually see that there you see this waterfall chart and you

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,500
see this little white box at the beginning of every block.

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,870
This is basically the setup time it takes to set up the HDP request.

34
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:54,710
So even though the files we are downloading are very small as you can tell this still takes some time

35
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,050
because of all that redundant extra setup for every HDTV request.

36
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,670
So doing less requests is a good idea anyways regardless of browser support.

37
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,670
So for these two reasons browsers support and less requests will have a look at bundling with Westpac

38
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,320
in the next course section.
