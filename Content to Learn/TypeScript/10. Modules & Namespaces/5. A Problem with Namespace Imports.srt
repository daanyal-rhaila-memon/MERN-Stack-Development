00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,500
Now one important note by the way you might be wondering why auto bind works here and project list even

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,890
though I didn't add import to the auto bind decorator.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:18,850
Well because an apt Yes I have all these imports now actually if I removed these import stare which

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:25,420
would be correct because in here I technically only use to project Input Project listings on we'll have

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:33,250
a problem you see if does reloads we have an error here even though we get no compilation error unfortunately

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,190
but we get a runtime error so we need to make sure we import everything we use in a file into that file

7
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,080
to be safe.

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,850
Technically we can import everything an apt Yes and since Project input and project list which for example

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,580
used the auto bind decorator come later the order by decorator will be available when they need it.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,340
But this is not the cleanest possible way.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,250
If you instead import everything a file needs from inside that file you have to guarantee that this

12
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,960
file will have it available when it needs it and you are not relying on some global file which imports

13
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,610
everything where you then might remove an import and suddenly everything breaks.

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,440
So what's the solution here.

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,520
Well let's go back to the files and import what they need.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,200
For example Project input does not just need the base component it also needs the validation logic and

17
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,310
order bind.

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:29,960
So in here I will import by going up one level with two dots from decorators the order bind decorator

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,740
whips like this.

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,800
And from you till the validation t s file that is definitely needed in this file here.

21
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:47,630
I also need the project state in here so I will import slash state project state yes and I will grab

22
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:53,600
these imports and go to project item and there I don't need the project state and validation so we can

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,760
remove that but we will need to order by and decorator we also need the Dragonball interface and the

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:10,040
project model so we'll also go to the models folder you're an import Project T S and drag dropped yes

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,570
in project list we won't need validation but I do need to project state in order bind.

26
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:26,280
And in addition from the models folder I need to project yes file and the drag drop test file with that

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,700
does safes and compiles and now it is all the works again as you see now we've got no runtime errors

28
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,030
because now we got all these imports back in the files so it is the proper way of doing it every file

29
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,120
specifies what it needs and we can split our code and still end up with one file so we get the best

30
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,800
of both worlds.

31
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,160
We could say yet this is not necessarily the best possible way of doing it.
