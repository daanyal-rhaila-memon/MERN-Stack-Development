1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,270
So we're using iOS modules.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:10,110
Turns out there are some variations of that export and import syntax which you should be aware of.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,120
For example you can bundle imports let's say here and project input where I'm importing two things from

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,440
the validation file here.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:26,230
You might want to group that all into one object where you then can call dot validate Abel and Dot validate

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,180
so that you don't have to call validate like this.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,480
Maybe you want to call it like this but if you had let's say a function of the same name in here or

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,040
anything like that and you want to a a name clash or you want to make it clear that this belongs to

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,810
some kind of package you could group that to group imports.

10
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,930
You don't import them like this with the curly braces but instead you use a star here which means import

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:57,670
everything from the file s and then any alias of your choice for example validation.

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,600
Now you have to go to the places where you use something from that file and use it like object validation

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,110
dot validate all so everything which is exported in that file which are now group under this name here

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,750
is access through the dot notation.

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,820
So validation dot validated Bill all the way and then all down there where we have to validate function.

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,340
It's of course validation dot validate validation dot validate and validation dot validate.

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,930
And with that you will see well validation works.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,080
So grouping is one thing you can do that Alice thing here is also something you can do in general you're

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,820
not liking order bind like this you want to have a capital character at the beginning while you can

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,830
simply assign an alias with the s keyword here inside of the curly braces.

21
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,030
You can use it as well.

22
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,180
Then you rename this import and only dis import you don't rename it in your original file of course

23
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,430
it's only imported under a different name in this file here.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,470
So now instead of using all the bind with a lowercase a here we now have to use our alias name with

25
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,520
the uppercase a.

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,550
So that can be a number nice feature to avoid name clashes if you had a number of thing named to bind

27
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:20,840
with a lowercase a in the same file for example you can also work with default exports if you have a

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,080
file which only exports one thing let's say base component.

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,910
Actually we have a lot of files that only export one thing.

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,130
But let's say here in this fall we don't want to export did like this a so-called named export because

31
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:40,700
we imported by name here in the curly braces we need to use the exact name we use here.

32
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,200
If you don't want to do that you simply add another keyword default.

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,180
And this tells javascript that this is the main well the default export office file you could still

34
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,320
have our named exports here.

35
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:03,690
That would be allowed whips for example a constant here that would be allowed you can if named and default

36
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,840
exports mixed in the same file but if you use a default export you can only have one default export

37
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,440
per file.

38
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,400
So here I have my default export and now in the files were imported.

39
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,670
You don't imported by name you can only import named exports by name for example.

40
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,930
That's something constant added.

41
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,640
Instead you import your default simply by choosing any name of your choice now which doesn't have to

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,930
match the name you used in the export that file so you don't have to use component.

43
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,560
Now you could you use just CFP for example here now and imported like this without curly braces.

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,050
There also is no star.

45
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,320
So I'm not importing everything I'm just importing the default.

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,830
Therefore this is only available if the file you're importing from has a default export because this

47
00:03:52,830 --> 00:04:00,300
tells javascript hey I want to use the default export of that file then here I can name the CFP of course

48
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,240
or I have to use CFP of course now component is not allowed anymore because I'm not importing it by

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,410
that name.

50
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,050
Of course we now all need to tweet this and project item and project list we used to default export.

51
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,820
I will stick to component here but you don't have to as I just showed you could use any name you want

52
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,820
here but for simplicity I will use component here.

53
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,790
Default exports can be nice if you only have one thing per file.

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,850
I personally prefer named exports though because you get auto completion you enforce a clear naming

55
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,610
pattern.

56
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:41,130
If another developer imports your class or your export that thing he has to use your name which typically

57
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,230
is good because it allows you to enforce certain naming conventions across a team or organization.

58
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,800
And therefore I personally like named exports but of course you should be aware of the default export

59
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
as well which you can use like that.
