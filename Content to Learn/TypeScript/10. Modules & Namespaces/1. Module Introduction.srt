00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,750
This is the code we ended up with at the end of the last course section.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:14,100
Our practice project a lot of code all in one file and this is arguably not a super complex project.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,010
You can definitely ride way more elaborate projects and applications and you would end up with way more

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,030
code so putting it all into one file is probably not what you want to do.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,660
So what you want to do instead is you want to write modular code which simply means you want to split

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,560
your code across multiple files so that each file on its own stays manageable and maintainable and you

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,620
then simply import and export from into these files and make sure that data for all these files are

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,490
connected but they're connected by typescript or by the browser or by some third party build tool and

9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,320
not by you.

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,430
By merging them all into one file during development.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,570
Now in this module we'll have a look at two main options that help us with organizing our code in multiple

12
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,360
files and we'll not just learn about them in theory but also in practice will of course apply these

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,300
different approaches and see how we can split our code.
