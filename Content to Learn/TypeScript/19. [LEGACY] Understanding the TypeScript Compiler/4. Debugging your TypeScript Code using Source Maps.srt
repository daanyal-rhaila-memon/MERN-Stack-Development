1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,100
Now as you might be able to imagine, there are a lot of options you can define here

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:13,630
and to be honest, a lot of them are options you'll rarely if never use. Two options you order to see here

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:20,530
which are created by default is the noImplicitAny option which is set to false and the sourceMap option, which is

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,780
also set to false.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:29,690
Now the sourceMap option should be pretty clear, if you set that to true and then compile your project,

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:37,460
then you see that not only does the Javascript file get created, we also get this .map file which

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,410
is the sourceMap for this file.

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,920
Now what's the advantage of the sourceMap?

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,280
Let's have a look at our running application, so I'll quickly

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,990
start my live server and then let's head over there and of course we don't see anything but if we click

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:57,500
on sources here in the Chrome developer tools, we see the app.js file of course which gets imported

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,240
and we also see the app.ts file.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,540
So even though we are running the Javascript file of course because that's the file we're importing

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,350
in the index.html file,

15
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,470
we got access to the ts file and we can even click into it,

16
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,480
set a breakpoint here in the developer tools and if I now reload this page,

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,270
we're actually pausing at that breakpoint

18
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:32,660
and then of course we can still continue code execution, so we can debug our TypeScript code directly

19
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,450
in the browser directly in the TypeScript file.

20
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,110
We don't have to debug in the Javascript file,

21
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:45,290
we can do this in the TypeScript file which of course is a great addition and a great and very important feature

22
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:52,790
which makes finding our errors much easier and that is achieved by setting this sorceMap option to true

23
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,220
which is not the default and I will turn it back to false here to have one less file being created

24
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,740
but if you are developing in a project, you probably might want to do this or might want to turn this

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,850
to true as it will give you source maps and make your production or your developer life really easier.
