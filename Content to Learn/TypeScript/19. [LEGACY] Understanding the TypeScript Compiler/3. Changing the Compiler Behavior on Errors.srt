1

00:00:01,930  -->  00:00:07,910
So in this tsconfig.json file, you can configure how your compiler should behave

2

00:00:08,260  -->  00:00:14,960
and this is a default file as it gets created once you run tsc init,

3

00:00:14,990  -->  00:00:17,910
what we did in the first module of this course.

4

00:00:17,930  -->  00:00:20,200
Now let's have a look at the base options we see here

5

00:00:20,330  -->  00:00:25,440
and let me also mention that in a later module of this course when we talk about the workflows, I'll also

6

00:00:25,460  -->  00:00:26,900
come back to this file

7

00:00:27,260  -->  00:00:32,210
but the base options are that we don't want to compile anything into node_modules folder because that

8

00:00:32,210  -->  00:00:38,100
is not our code, that we want to resolve our modules to be CommonJS format

9

00:00:38,120  -->  00:00:43,190
and I'll come back to this in the namespace in modules folder, that the target version to which we

10

00:00:43,190  -->  00:00:45,280
want to compile is ES5

11

00:00:45,290  -->  00:00:51,620
and you could change this to ES3 or ES6 but ES5 as the default as it runs in pretty much all

12

00:00:51,620  -->  00:00:52,600
browsers

13

00:00:53,210  -->  00:00:56,630
and then these two options. Now I'll come back to that,

14

00:00:56,690  -->  00:00:58,280
these options in a second,

15

00:00:58,370  -->  00:01:04,820
now let's first try to fix this behavior if we don't want it of TypeScript compiling code if it has

16

00:01:04,910  -->  00:01:10,870
errors. We can add a new key here which is named noEmitOnError

17

00:01:12,020  -->  00:01:17,020
and we can set this to true which is not the default, the default is false which is why it is not included

18

00:01:17,030  -->  00:01:17,730
here.

19

00:01:18,170  -->  00:01:21,690
So noEmitOnError is that

20

00:01:21,710  -->  00:01:26,220
now we shouldn't get this app.js file if we have a compilation error.

21

00:01:26,360  -->  00:01:30,440
So I just deleted it and now I try to run tsc again.

22

00:01:30,440  -->  00:01:31,800
Now we get the error

23

00:01:32,180  -->  00:01:37,090
as you can see, no js file to be found.

24

00:01:37,550  -->  00:01:42,790
So if you want that behavior, that your file doesn't get created in case of any errors, you can force

25

00:01:42,790  -->  00:01:46,170
it with this simple option here.

26

00:01:46,250  -->  00:01:50,630
If you don't want this behavior, so if you want the default behavior of the Javascript file getting

27

00:01:50,630  -->  00:01:56,300
created nonetheless, simply remove this option and you're back to the default where you get these

28

00:01:56,300  -->  00:02:01,610
files and you have to handle these errors more like a it's a warning way.

29

00:02:01,640  -->  00:02:05,060
It's no hard error preventing your project from running,

30

00:02:05,060  -->  00:02:10,580
it's just a warning that there might be something which is wrong or that you might be making some mistake

31

00:02:10,600  -->  00:02:10,800
.
