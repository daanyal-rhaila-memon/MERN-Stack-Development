1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,350
Now what's this noImplicitAny thing here?

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,820
Well you might be able to guess this, if I go back to the app.ts file and I create a new variable,

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,290
anything

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,990
and I set anything equal to 12, that is valid TypeScript code

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:25,870
and if I go to my console and I comment out the erroneous code here and I compile this, you'll see it

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,860
compiled without an error.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,090
Now this of course is of type any but it's not of type any because we set it to type any but because

8
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,470
we didn't set anything,

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,640
so it was implicitly set to type any.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,270
Now with that, it should be pretty clear what happens if I set noImplicitAny to true.

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:52,280
If I do this and run my compiler, now I get an error that the variable anything implicitly has an any

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,240
type

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,720
and this is simply again a warning or combined with the other option I showed you before, even a reason

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,820
why your code won't be compiled at all because you're using this implicitly.

15
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:11,980
So it's really a good warning which kind of reminds you, hey maybe you want to assign a type here,

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,700
no?

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,720
So it might get you to write better code

18
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,160
but of course you don't have to use it

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,900
and in a default tsconfig file, it is set to false but again, you may of course use it.

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:31,620
And keep in mind if you set it to true, you're still allowed to explicitly set this to any, with that

21
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,950
this code compiles without issues.

22
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,980
It's only this implicit any which is not allowed, so I'm going to set this to false.
