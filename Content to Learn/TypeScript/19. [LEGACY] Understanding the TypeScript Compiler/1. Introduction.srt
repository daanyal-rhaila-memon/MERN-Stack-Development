00:00:09,430  -->  00:00:14,640

00:00:14,830  -->  00:00:20,800
We had a brief look at this in the last module when we saw that the type assignments don't actually

00:00:20,800  -->  00:00:22,710
get compiled to Javascript.

00:00:22,930  -->  00:00:29,800
Well let's dive into this a little bit more in this module where I'll briefly consider the TypeScript compiler,
